competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. how does competitiveness affect individuals? is it a positive or negative trend?,"life is full of competition. soon after the release from competitive university exams, the hard fighting for higher positions in a company will be waiting for you. while the competitiveness has been bringing us a convenient society, no small number of employments have been tired of never-ending competitions. no doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. this essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of japanese modern society and typical japanese office workers. i believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.
firstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. if there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. the evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the hr evaluation. for example, japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. however, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? most japanese companies adopted the hr evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. that’s why the japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. in addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. this tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.
secondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. as a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.
consequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns. karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in japan. we may need to rethink about the competitiveness.",7.5
people are having more and more sugar-based drinks. what are the reasons? what are the solutions to make people drink less.,"sugar-based drinks has become a popular beverage amongst the people especially in today's generation, the millenials. this essay will outline possible reasons on why people are consuming such drinks and also some ways for them to consume less.
to start, sugar is the main component of this beverage. study shows that consuming this can boost a person's energy levels. hence athelete ae addicted to this refreshments such as energy drinks. furthermore, this can increase mental alertness especially to working individuals. for instance, not all workers has the capability to maintain their energy at work, sometimes they tend to get sleepy leading them to buy sugary drinks like milk teas. not only that, advertisement can also be a factor. for example, young people gets curious whenever new sugared drinks is advertised especially if this is shown by their favorite icon. lastly, consumer's lack of knowledge and misinformation regarding their product as evident by the coca cola lawsuit.
although it may be difficut for people to stay away from this. there are ways that can help them drink less. one solution is for government to impose a price hike. meaning high price can discourage them to buy this drinks. second, just like alcohol, buying sugar-based drinks at malls or grocery store should have time limit. for instance, whoever will buy and sell beyond the allotted time should pay a fine. also, educating the public about the health issue of drinking too much sugar-based drinks should be prioritize. finally, government should encourage company such as pepsico, and the coca-cola company to be transparent of their nutritional facts.
in conclusion, sugar-based drinks has become popular due to advertisements and society's thinking that it can replenish their energy levels. in contrast, goverment should take the first step educate and encourage individuals to mimimize drinking this.",7.0
"in many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it to be a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. what is your opinion on this?","in the third world, children are usually sent to factories for laborious work. many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. in any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.first of all, children are not workers. they have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. since these innocent children are naive and , they can be easily cheated and exploited. there are many examples of this in poor nations. because using children is cheap and to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated.moreover, children do not need such thing as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. the brief responsibility of children is learning. they are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. this will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . in addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.in conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work. hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.",6.0
the graph below shows the number of university graduates in canada from 1992 to 2007.summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.,"the line graph illustrates the proportion of male and female students graduated from canadian universities from 1992 to 2007.
overall, there were 40. 000 more female graduates than male graduates in 1992 and this trend remained constant for the given time period.
in the starting year, in 1992 the rate of the female gender representatives was slight below 100.000, after which line grew up to approximately 105.000 in 1995 and again dropped down to 100.000 between 1997 and 1998. this graph steadily increased in 1998 and peaked at over 148. 000 in 2007.

"the use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","despite the fact that physical punishment of pupils at schools is decreasing, it is considered by many that it improves discipline. this essay completely disagrees with this view because such measures are applied to those who are unable to counterattack and it maybe the easiest way but also the most inhumane.
firstly, physical assault is usually applied by teachers against children who are not able to stop the violence. in other words, it is not highly probable that an adolescent will try to hurt a teenager who may stop the hitting or even push it back. thus, kids are at higher risk because the only thing they are able to do in such cases is just try to run away. moreover, children should understand that they earn what they deserve meaning that the level of repercussions should correspond to the seriousness of so called crime. for example, sweden schools have publicly available the set of rules and non-physical measures that will be taken against the violators, that confirms that other methods are also effective to keep appropriate kids’ behaviour.
secondly, it is much more easier for many to maintain a discipline using the fear of corporal punishment. this means that it seems unnecessary and time-waste for grown-ups to try to apply other methods while a hectic kid may be calmed down just in few seconds using the fear of pain. pupils may not be involved in a lesson and interrupt a teacher because they are not interested in the subject that may be caused by the fact that the teacher was not able to select appropriate technics to convey knowledge. for example, a research conducted by a us institution revealed that 90% of corporal punishments were applied to pupils who did not l listened to their teachers during a lesson.
in conclusion, physical violence should be discontinued in schools because mostly weak kids are in danger and they are subject for such punishments because adolescents chose the simplest way of violence and fear to better the behaviour.",6.5
"write about the following topic.in many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.discuss both these views and give your own opinion.give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","nowadays having a job is a common type of lifestyle for all individuals. as a matter of fact, jobs are very important because is the only way that people have to earn money. however, in many countries, the distribution of salary is not equal and a small number of people earn higher salaries than others.
some individuals think that this is good for the country because goverment encourage only categories that are more in touch with money, such as employees who work in banks, offices and who has a business. in other words, the economy of the country can increase in a significant way since goverments incentivate these categories by giving them extremely high salaries.
on the other hand, there are those who argue that goverments should not allow salaries above a certain level because there are a lot of employees, such as workers and teachers that have a very small salary. in fact, they are the ones who works for the wealth and the future of the society and it is unfair that they are discourage. moreover, i also believe that these kind of jobs are more stressful and challenging than others and they work as good as categories that have higher salaries.
in conclusion, i hold the view that everybody should have an equal distribution of salary and it is unfair that goverments incentivate only a certain category of workers. all individuals should be paid according to the commitment they give and we should not think only about the economy of the country.",6.5
"the proportion of older people is increasing, what problems will this cause and what solutions can be suggested?","in many countries the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. what problems will this cause for individuals and society? suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.it is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.as people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. the main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. the proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. in other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.there are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. a second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.in conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.this essay covers the task requirements, however some problems of aging population get only a brief mention. the linking of sentences in the second body paragraph is somewhat ‘mechanical’ and could have been improved. information sequencing and organisation in paragraphs are done well. the range of vocabulary and the fluency of its use, as well as lack of errors are impressive. overall, this is a good example of how to get band 8 without writing a very long essay.",8.0
reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. this kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"nowadays, more and more criminal activities and violent events are showed on television and in newspapers. some people consider that we should restrict those kinds of information because of the adverse outcomes. however, in my opinion, those events shown in the media should not be restricted for the following reasons.
firstly, reporting of criminal activities and other violent news can reduce crimes. if those criminal and violent information can be showed to the public, people can clearly understand the whole process and detailed scenes of crimes, provoking them more easily think critically serious consquences. abusing durgs, for example, people will be afarid of the severe effects on both social and personal areas when they vivily see real outcomes it may bring, thus prevent them from committing criminal acts. hence, there will be fewer criminal activities or violent events occurring on our society. that is why we should not restrict criminal activities being shown in the media.
in addition, restricting the criminal activities may lead to a high rate of crimes. if people cannot easily obtain those information, they may consider that no one care about it and even take part in some criminal activities without thinking. because they cannot image detailed impacts on social and personal aspects when they think wether can do it or not. finally, to a large extent, they may commit cirmes and cause some severe consquences, which may bring nagative effects on society.
in conclusion, i agree that we should show criminal activities and violent events in the media , which can largely reduce crimes. moreover, we should also think much more about that restricting this kind of information may lead to a high rate of crimes.",6.5
the bar charts below shows the number of visits to a community website in the first and second year of use.summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and mae comparisons with relevant.,"the bar chart illustrates the figure for uses of a community website during the first and the second year after it is created.
overall, it can be seen that the number of visits to the website in each month in the second year is more than the figure in the first year noticeably, except for august. additionally, the website gains popularity differently, depending on the periods of the year.
looking at the detail, at the beginning of each year the record commences at below 5,000 uses. this figure then plateaus to 10,000 uses and around 17,500 uses in december of the first and the second year respectively. after that, from december to february the website popularity declines to almost zero for the first year which is the lowest record and 10,000 uses for the second year. in the following month, even though the number in the first year increases slightly, the number in the second year remains unchanged.
nevertheless, between march and june the figure starts to rise for a second time to approximately 12,500 uses in the first year and more than 20,000 uses in the second year. then, the number of both years stays at this level until july. on august, the popularity in the second year drops to below 15,000 uses while the number in the first year continues increasing, exceeding the number in the second year.",6.5
"the bar chart below shows the number of houses built per year in two cities, derby and nottingham, between 2000 and 2009. write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.you should write at least 150 words.","the bar chart depicts the number of houses constructed per year ni two cities between 2000 to 2009. overall, it is clear that the number of houses built in derby steadily increased, while there are huge variations in the number of houses in nottingham like a seesaw.
initially, the number of houses newly built started at less than 50 in derby in 2000. then the number of houses increased and exceeded 100 in 2003. the number of houses remained almost the same until 2007, but the number of houses suddenly skyrocketed to 250 in 2008. as a result, the number of houses had nearly 350 in 2009.

present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money. this practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.to what extent is this style of management effective?are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"there is no doubt that rewarding employees wirh extra money can have positive effects on the quality of work. however, there are many different ways is which employers can implement to increase theit employees satisfaction in the work environment. in this essay, i will discuss why money incetives can be beneficial, and mention different alternatives.
rewarding employees with money is one of the best ways to guarantee employees retantion and prevent employees tunrover. this is because most people work to provide better life for them and their families, and extra money can help them achieve that. as a result, companies can increase their employees satisfaction and encourage them turn off job offers. for example, yearly bounses are one of the main incentives to encourage people to work harder. however, companies who do not pay enough bounses can loss many special employees.
while money is considerd as one of the main reasons why employees are satisfied, it can add extra expenses on the companies, which can affect their future success. managers can use different ways to encourage employees to work harder by saying thank you or giving them extra day off after a long project, which can have a positive effect on the work quality. for instance, in some private companies in saudi arabia, managers usually reward their staff by giving them day off when there is an important football match or when the weather is great.
in conclusion, while money incentives can reduce employees turnover, not all companies have the ability to implement this soultion. however, a much cheaper incentives can be used to achieve the same results.",5.5
"the bar charts below show the number of hours each teacher spent teaching in different schools in four different countries in 2001.write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.","the given bar charts display the number of hours each teacher spent education in different schools in four different countries in 2001. overall, it is clear that the usa spent much higher hours in lower secondary and upper secondary school than the three countries, whereas there are no significant differences in the number of hours in primary school in the four countries.

in many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). why? is this a positive or negative development?,"money can not buy happiness! is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. it is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. in my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. i will address some of both sides in this essay.
talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!
nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.
in conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. however, i believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life.",7.0

"the charts below compare the age structure of the populations of france and india in 1984.write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.","the charts demonstrate the sex distribution in a various of age groups between france and india in 1984.
by and large, the males and females in the population of france almost balanced each other particularly in the age groups of 0-65 years old in 1984 with a symmetric sex composition. the age group 30-35 was revealed to be the highest percentages of population in france whereas the largest proportion of indian population was in the age group 0-5 with a skewed sex ratio.

write about the following topic.many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. why? does this development have advantages and disadvantages?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"nowadays, written language is used in comparatively more informal and relaxed way. i assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. this option is essential in a modern temp of life. this essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.
the less formal and tense written language provides some pros. first of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.
on the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. firstly, communication goes less respectful. then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. in these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features. if participants of the communication are not close, they will not understand each other correctly.
in conclusion i would like to say that the process of using written language in a more informal way has both advantages and disadvantages. it can be revealed in different situations. that is why everyone should have their own opinion based on the information discussed in this essay.",5.0

write about the following topic.group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone.do you agree or disagree?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"group or team activities are great ways of teaching more important life skills, however, there are activities which can be done alone that will also teach some important skills. both ones are important in teaching life skills. below, we will see which one of them is a great way of teaching more important life skills.
first of all, we need to understand that doing activities in group, or as a team can help us deepen our knowlodge, because they provide us with the ability to share ideas and learn from each other which is something crucial in our daily lives as human being as we were all created to live together as communities. in addition, group or team activities will not only allow us to know the other person living next us but to figure out what their feelings are and to be patient to them when they need us. however, doing activities alone have also its own benefits.
in fact, personal activities or some of them we do alone can give us some understanding about how the world is spinning around us as well. firsthand, sometimes we need to do a few activities alone as this can help us to develop some personal important life skills to know exacly who we really are and what is our mission on the earth. second, doing personal activities such as walking out, or going for a walk will not only strengthen our physical being but also to be mentally healthy.
in conclusion, both of them have positive and negative aspects to consider. however, in my opinion, doing activities in group or as a team can teach more important life skills than those activities which are done alone because group activities let us explore the world around us which will later teach us important skills which are necessary for our survival.",6.5
write about the following topic.some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. to what extent do you agree or disagree?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"most vehicles release a toxic amount of fumes into the atmosphere. this, in turn, has grown into an environmental issue of global concern that governments across the world believe can be mitigated by adding on to the price of fuels. i chiefly disagree with the effectiveness of this method as next to nothing had been altered since the policy enforcement due to convenience issues.
the number of cars utilizing fuel has not dwindled. even though many alternatives had been suggested, there was no mass production of transportation units for the use of average salary workers. the middle crust of society does not possess sufficient income to shift to environmentally friendly solutions for the fear of maintenance hardships. for instance, an electrical car would necessitate a spacious charging spot in front of a garage that not many possess. as a consequence, the more convenient and trustworthy solution to buy fuel is resorted to.
the population of the world as a whole does not stay in one place. as more and more people are born, there is a growing need for transport to be manufactured in a short span of time. although a part of the population may be able to abandon their cars in exchange for bikes or buses, a significant portion of the growing society still opts for refueling cars in gas stations to get to places faster.
in conclusion, while the idea of the price policy introduction bore few fruits, they had not been enough to make a contribution to solving the carbon footprint. ironically, people would rather overspend for their comfort than think about nature.",9.0
"write about the following topic.although there are a lot of translation software available, learning a language could still be advantageous. to what extent do you agree or disagree?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. however, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.
first of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. for instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by ai. thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.
another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. if you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.
moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. it helps to develop memory and imagination. for instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.
finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. then online translators are not available. but if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.
to sum up, i definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.",6.5

"nowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. do you agree or disagree?","it is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. from singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. in my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.many of today’s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. for instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. in addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. these types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.poor morals aren’t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. they routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. this kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.to conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society’s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. in the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.",8.0

first of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. it helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. for examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality.

certainly, the use of the internet needs to be regulated if we want to preserve our privacy when using it. unfortunately, there is an enormous flow of our personal data on the internet. for example, we eagerly share a lot of information about ourselves simply from our name, address, phone number to more serious one like our accounts number or social security. however, the big sales companies very often buy an access to this data to target us and influence our choices. this practice should be illegal and we as the users need to have a say how our personal data should be handled on the internet. for this reason, we need to demand privacy laws to have better control how our personal information is managed on the internet.
another risk of having the internet free from regulation is that we have no means of protection from unreliable information. i find this risk very dangerous since many people have used the internet as their primary source of news and rely on it to stay updated with daily news. now, anybody can become a reporter as long as he or she has access to the internet. simply, people can write and post their comments that often don’t have any factual or scientific base. we have witnessed this misinformation during the debate regarding vaccinations for the covid-19. many people who objected to be vaccinated made up their mind reading some posts on the facebook or the twitter that stated harmfulness of vaccines. these posts are allowed to be posted, because the social media don’t have any obligation to check the content of posts. clearly, this wouldn’t happen if there were some forms of regulations that can verify better factual content of information on the internet, so the potential readers can avoid the risk of misinformation.
surely, the internet can no longer stay without any regulatory laws. these policies are necessary to protect our privacy and keep us informed with more reliable information. simply, the regulation polices of the internet give us more power to be in control when using the internet to obtain information or share personal data.",7.5

write about the following topic.rich countries should allow jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees who are from poor countries. do you agree or disagree?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"throughout modern history there have always been professional and gifted individuals from developed countries who aspire to immigrate into more developed societies. recently this trend has been more emphatic resulting in a disputable discussion which has been widely talked about. should rich governments permit local workplaces to recruit foreign employees? i personally agree with this point of view and i will elaborate on the reasons in this essay.
there are several possible advantages of hosting employers from poor countries. first, foreign employees can bring with them new innovations and methods of research which in turn will enrich the local markets and possibly contribute to enhancing the knowledge. in addition, foreign employers are generally paid lower income in comparison to local workers, this could save up money for other investments. moreover, a swarm of skilled immigrants will probably increase the competition among local employers and encourage them to improve in different aspect in order to secure employment.
there are other aspects which merit consideration. most of the foreign employers would utilize their occupation in the developed countries in improving their skills and knowledge and might consider going back to their homelands. this knowledge transfer would probably benefit both sides. as developed nations will employ the new comers and harness their experience in developing the education, health and other forms. interestingly, this prosperity in developed countries will presumably lower the influx of unemployed and illiterate immigrants into the rich countries.
to conclude, i agree with the title statement regarding the several advantages of such an action. historically, if rich countries had adopted skilled people from poor nations, there would have probably been fewer immigrants into their developed countries with all the know repercussions of this phenomenon.",7.5
some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children's development than playing computer games. this essay will elaborate a point of agreement to the above statement.
to commence with the first reason, outdoor activities are good for children's health. as children run and play with ones' friends, outdoor activities will apparently relieve the stress. furthermore, it is scientifically proven that an exercise is beneficial for all mankind as it is recommended by the doctors and scientists. for instance, doctors encourage the patients who have non-communicable diseases, known as lifestyle illnesses, to exercise more. thus, it will prevent children from getting illnesses.
additionally, spending time with one's friends will definitely help a child to build a healthy relationship with others. as a child learns universal values and realizes important aspects of life, it will greatly influence the way a child will live one's life. for example, a child can learn sportsmanship while playing sports with his or her friend.
on the other hand, playing computer games can lead a child to be addicted with electronic gadgets. addiction is one of the most risky things which may put one's life into a pit. if a computer game consists of violent or aggressive contents within it, a child may get influenced. there are a great number of reports and thesis which focus on how computer games affect the children's behaviour in a negative way.
moreover, electrical gadgets affect one's eyesight. nowdays, as most of people are exposed to the lights from the devices, it can be easily proven that there are more people with glasses comparing to the past. using a computer for a short period of time is not risky, however, using a computer for a long time for certain purposes, even if it is for research work, it will affect one's eyesight badly.
to conclude, it is proven that outdoor activities are more beneficial than playing computer games. therefore, communities, parents, and teachers ought to encourage children to do outdoor activities rather than ordering a child be sitted for a long time, the act which causes unhealthiness.",5.5

as for those who support the control of the internet use, they may have their position grounded upon the fact that criminal activities run rampant online, threatening individual and public security, as exemplified by hacking technology aimed at stealing personal data illegally, fraudulent advertisements aimed at cheating money and notices post by terrorist groups brainwashing the public. such activities, if unchecked, may exert undesirable effects on individuals and society. given such omnipresent dangers online, the control of online activities may be justified.
on the contrary, in terms of those objecting to the control of the internet use, they may justify their position by highlighting importance of unlimited online activities, as demonstrated by the improvement of work efficiency. a case in point is that posting advertisements online is apparently more efficient than issuing leaflets on a street, from the perspective of a company intending to publicising its services and products. however, the notices post online may present fake information cheating the public. to address this issue, it is necessary to control online activities.
as far as i am concerned, in view of omnipresent hazards online, intervention is needed to screen dangerous information and ensure the safety of the internet use.
to conclude, the control of online activities helps to protect us from various cybercrimes, although it may slightly affect the efficiency of work. personally, i opine that the importance of online control should not be underestimated.",8.5

firstly, the higher the remunerative wealth makes life easy for citizens. because now it is difficult to find jobs, therefore, these profitable companies could afford you one in your rich country. some people may believe that people would be careless, that is not true. because people are the main purposes of making this wealth, and they also want to develop their country and make it more knownable for the rest of life. moreover, living in a rich country gives a priority for a good life.
furthermore, the increase of economic wealth changes the view of other countires and citizens. having a high economic wealth could change the life of people. all of the people are greedy no matter what you do they want more and more, therefore, people are developing their county to have a high salary and live a tranquil life.
to conclude, having an increase of economic wealth in a country changes the lives of citizens. people are trying to develop the countries to make it more knownable and a prominent figure in life. meanwhile, people are greedy they want more that what they deserve so by the increase of lurcative wealth they could get higher than what they deserve.",5.0

some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. discuss both views and give your opinion.,"there is an opinion which is that the longer prison sentences is the best solution to reduce crime. on the contrary, some people say that there are better solutions to solve this problem. overall, i totally agree with the latter opinion because i think that giving long prison sentences can not directly reduce crime.
firstly, i observe the advantage about giving longer prison sentences. surely, people may hesitate to commit crime by strict sentences. even if they would commit crime, they would have to be in prison for long days. in addition, living in prison for a long time may give a time to reflect themselvs for them.
however, if crimers would be in the prison for a long time, it might be difficult for them to make them living on themselves because they might not be used to the social reality. it may cause them to commit crime again.
in addition to this, i think the poverty and a lot of burdens which people have may cause to commit crime. because of two reasons, i think that countries have to propose policies which can stimulate economy and relieve their anxieties. recently, many countries have experienced a recession. it cause the increasing the unemployment rate, so a lot of people suffer from hunger because of the povery. it will be supposed to cause them commit crime such as robbing. then, people have many burdens because of woriking, raising their children and caring their parens. they have a lot of stress, so even if they could not reduce their stress, they might commit crime to reduce their mental pain. they may want a relax time.
i think the latter opinion is more valid than the former by these reasons. these are my opinion about this problem.",6.0

"write about the following topic.to meet the growing need for food to support an increasing population, a country should make use of edible insects as a food source. however, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. what are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","nowadays, populations are growing all over the world, and increasing the source of food is becoming more important and also being challenging nowadays. one of the most important matters nowadays is eating insects and unhealthy sources of natural food. some people in some areas are getting benefits from eating insects as a meal where insects are the worst scenario in nature.
however, there is some cultivating support that comes from insects which is a positive impact on the land or cultivating areas. such as, it helps plants to grow fast and healthier. many people use insects in their cultivating land as organic manure. it reduces dying trees and plants and provides enough energy and nutrition to plants to grow faster, healthier, and keep fresh. all over the world, people in so many areas are most familiar with those insects. by using insects on their land, they are doing it with less cost and more efficiency and also they are not providing too much effort to get insects as it comes from nature so easily.

"write about the following topic.psychologists have known for many years that colour can affect how people feel. for this reason, attention should be given to colour schemes when decorating places such as offices and hospitals.how true is this statement?how far does colour influence people’s health and capacity for work?","the role of colors in our psycological life is crucial. some people suggest hence to pay attention on color schemes when workplaces or hospital are decorated. i agree that colors affect people's psychological health. a particular place's decoration can arouse a determinate feeling that could favour or penalise the capacity of people in a work place.
colors affect our psycological life. they possess an extraordinary social role. it is not a case that the famous table of emotions is presented in different colors where the different colors represent different emotions. for instance, blue incline people to be sad while red is said to be the color of passion, and move strongly the emotions of a person by setting of her pleasures. lastly the grey's shades stimulate anxiety. therefore, i think that the hospital's walls or officies cannot be decorated in grey or blue as long as it is better to stimulate their positiveness and productivity. thre is a curious story about princess sissi, that confirm the impact of color in our life. she was obsessed about her wight and fitness. for this reason, she decored purple all the walls of her appartmanets. indeed, pourple is said to be the color which stimulates the absence of hunger. thus, when the princess was there it was easier for her to be fast.
by contrast, there are also some colors that stimulate fantasy, creativity and peace. green is one of that color. then, to decorate hospitals with green shades could be a good way to produce positive vibes in people who are sicks. moreover, yellow is defined as the color that describes the feeling of being proud, aware and confident. then, using this color in the walls of the officies will stimulate workers to do their better. their capacity in the work-place will be maximased by the general environment.
in conclusion, i believe that colors affect our psychological life and then people should pay attention in the feelings they stimulate when they decore a room or a building intented to welcome a particular type of people like sicks people or workers. psychological life is important and relevant as the physical one and colors can affects our moods as well as physical accidents do.",5.5

"these days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. why is that happening? how can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?","nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. it seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. if that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. a recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. that is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.to address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. for example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. as a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. this would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.to sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.",8.0
"while many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. do you agree or disagree?","nowadays, with the development of education, more and more students go to colleges for academic learning. however, some people consider that we should provide more vocational courses because a lack of practical workers such as electricians and plumbers. personally, i think academic study is obviously important bacause it can improve the technology and the misunderstanding of job-not the lack of vocational training- is the main reason for a lack of labored workers.
it is no doubt that the academic learning in university can induct the practical training and provoke the development of technology in different areas such as agricuture. if we deeply understand the theory of academic knowledge and reasonablely apply them in different fields, we could efficiently improve the technology and help human beings to increase their living standard. for instance, the development of drones turly improve the quantity of crops, which is benifit for famers. however, this technology need a lot of basic theories to invent the drones and teach worker to handle this machine. at this time, the academic study becomes much more important for practical workers.
some people claim that it is because a lack of vocational training, thus leading to a lack of qualified worker. however, in my opinion, i think there are mainly two reasons come from the misunderstanding of jod cause this bad situation. for one aspect, some people think that practical workers usually cannot earn much more money compared to empolyees working in office. thus, they just give up this occupation for their career. for another aspect, some people do not respect those qualified worker, which make them feel their job are secondary. at last, there are no more people would like to choose this type of works.

"nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. what are the reasons for this problem? what are the effects on society?","in recent time, it is observed that the number of students enrolling for science or mathematics in higher education is decreasing all over the world. there are plenty of reasons that are causing this decline which will affect the society negatively. in this essay, i will discuss why the number of pupils is deacreasing who prefer science stream and what will be the impacts on a community if it continues.
the main reason of this situation is lack of trained science and mathematics teachers. stem teachers are not able to kindle the joy of learning among students. if students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to pursue stem subjects, they will develop math or science phobia. subsequently, they will rather prefer other streams to complete their higher education.
eventually, this situation will impact the scociety in many ways. firstly, there would be scarcity of doctors all over the world which will affect health sector dramatically. eventually, people will suffer with many health problems. secondly, if students do not take stem subjects in university, there will not be stem teachers to teach future generation. according to me, government must take firm steps to avoid these situations in future. there must be some training program to keep stem teachers up to date to enhance their teaching. this will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students, for instance, teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process.
to conclude, i believe that government and teachers should take the resposibility to create the conducive environment to learn these subjects in fun way. this will, eventually, increase the number of students enrolling for stem subjects in recent future. otherwise, it may have negative impacts on society which will not be a good sign for any country.",7.0

write about the following topic.few people devote time to hobbies nowadays. say why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"hobbies are recreational activities that are pursued away from one's school or work. they are meant to be an escape from the mundane and a way of keeping people sane and happy. unfortunately, they have become almost a luxury in today's fast-paced world.
several reasons can account for this massive decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. one such reason is the fact that hobbies require time and money which are two very dear resources in today's world. social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. what used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit. even if one has the money to pursue such, he or she would have to set aside time in his or her busy schedule to enjoy those hobbies. it is therefore no wonder that most people found to pursue hobbies today are either wealthy youth or comfortable pensioners.
secondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. this is seen in a lot of ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.
moreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. after a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.
this lack of hobby pursuit, though understandable, does the individual and society more harm than good. many individuals today are being treated for one mental health or another. hobbies are a good way to relax and destress through leisure and can go a long way to improve mental health. its absence will only wreak havoc for the society, which will only consist of tired and apathetic individuals who could not care less about each other and their surroundings.
in conclusion, it is important, albeit difficult, to pay attention to hobbies in order to improve the health and psyche of the individual and society as a whole. more effort should be geared at encouraging hobbies at school and at the work place.",8.0

on the one hand, prioritizing economic progress is important because it is the basis that sustains every countries' needs. without a strong economy, governments would not be able to afford education or health. for instance many studies show that wealthier countries tend to give their citizens a better life quality.
on the other hand, other types of progress such as educational, technological and health developements can lead to better outcomes in society. for instance it has been proven that countries with the best quality of education tend to be more peaceful and have less crime rates than those where education is not a priority.
in my opinion education, health and technological progress when available to evryone can lead to better developement not only financial but also in the equality of opportunies which is the key to much more content and peaceful societies. governments that value economy over everything else tend to forget that the true value relies on the people and their needs, not in making money. economy progress is part of a developed society but should not rely at the centre of issues because well being and good quality of life is a complex goal that requires success in many areas of society.",7.0

"while many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. do you agree or disagree?","in today's era, most students look forward to enrolling in professional courses at universities. however, some believe that authorities should encourage teenagers to take vocational courses as there is a huge shortage of professionals like electricians and plumbers. in my opinion, while there is a scarcity of such workers and the government should make special arrangements for prospective learners, certain other factors should also be considered.
due to the insufficient work possibilities after completing vocational courses and extremely low wages, scholars are forced to take loans at high interest from banks to attend university programmes. an average adult has to pay more than 70,000 usd yearly for a typical professional course at a university, and most children are unable to accumulate sufficient funds in time, which forces them to borrow this amount from banks. the job market for plumbing and electrical work is highly unregulated, which leads to the exploitation of such workers by the established brands, further distressing the people. some regulations should be established for these markets to decrease the risk factor for workers.
on the other hand, due to the continuing increase in our population, the demand for doctors, engineers, and professors is also rising. in recent years, governments from all over the world have reported the widening gap between the number of professionals available per 1000 people. for example, in india, there is only 1 doctor available per 50 people in urban areas, and the number is even more concerning in rural areas, where the figure of patients climbs even further.
in my opinion, authorities and universities should work together towards introducing scholarships and other benefits not only for learners of professional courses but also for peoples of vocational courses. furthermore, better and more wages for plumbers and electricians could also be established to attract more students.
in conclusion, favourable policies should be implemented for qualified workers to attract more potential learners by the government, as well as lower tution fees for university attendees.",9.0

at first, showing the violent events can decresae some serious crimes. if the public can directly get the criminal informations, which lead to a whole understanding of the criminal process, provoking them more easily to thinking critically inculding the bad effects on social and personal areas. take abusing drugs for example, people will afraid to touch drugs if they can vividly see the serious outcomes of abuse, which can effectly prevent them to do some crimnal things. thus, there wil be less crimes and other kinds of violent events happened in our society.
secondly, restricting the news of crimes to the public may increase the rate of crimes. take it into more detaily, if people cannot directly obtain the criminal informations, they maybe cannot analysis the the broad of law, thus easily drop into crimes. when they have to choose whether to do or not, they can not consider more details of the serious outcomes for different kinds of criminal events and they just do it. at last, leading a severe consquences which have adverse impact on both social and personal fields.

the reason why i agree with this statement is because society today is built up on finance resources. people somehow believe that if you do not have expensive things or an amazing car you are below them. since money is the merit of a popularity and a good life, many people are remaining in the same job if they are going to be promoted or they are going to receive a pay raise soon, even though coworkers are poisonous and bad for their mental health. for example, it is easier to stay in their position with good money and bad colleagues than to change their job and try to make their way up again.
on the other hand, a lot of youngsters will probably choose the good working environment and nice group of people with who they will be working with, before a long payroll. of course, it is pleasant to receive a huge amount of money every month but, if you will be working with people who are rude and annoying, you will be out of energy soon and moreover your workforce will be lower as same as your payment in the end.
in conclusion, i mostly agree with this averment because money is the great motivation for people, but i would also like to point up the importance of a great working group as it is another reason why to choose to stay where you are.",6.0
a country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.to what extent do you agree or disagree?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"a nation becomes more interesting and advance faster when the population contains a blended numbers of nationalities. this essay completely agrees with this statement, because this will lead every ethnic group to reflect their lifestyles , and also boost the tourism industry.
on the one hand, when every ethnic group reflects the society they belong to it. this will helps in creating postive representation of the society as they will learn about each others through several ways , like food, clothes and traditions. for example, a survey conducted by the minstry of tourism in egypt showed around 90 percent of people agreed that this will helps to fill the gap of cultural differences, as it will facilitates communication across nations and enhance confidence and trust between both cultures.
on the other hand, tourism industry will benefit when the population is blended. this is because, alot of tourists will be attracted to that foreign destination. so, this will boost the economy of the nation as growing numbers of jobs will be available.as as result, unemployment rate will decrease. for instance, australia benefited from the tourism industry especially in areas like queensland and sydney, where a large number of vacant jobs is available which resulted in growing economy.
in conclusion , a society contains a mixture of nationalities will helps it to grow culturally and economically. as every ethinic group will learn about each others, it will also benefit the economy, as a result more jobs will be available and unemployment rate will decrease.",7.0

nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree),"nowadays families move to different countries for work. some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. discuss both views and give your own opinion.recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, i agree with those who believe the opposite is true.those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. there is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. as a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. it is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.nevertheless, i firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. it fosters young social and emotional capabilities. moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. according to a recent study published by the university of chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.in conclusion, i strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.this essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. the writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. the arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes. this essay seems worthy of ielts band 8.",8.0
"some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. do you think this is positive or negative development?discuss both views and give your opinion.","there is some countries attain international sports by making and buliding unique specialised facilities to develop and improve top athletes, rather than providing sports facilities that anyone else can use.
in my opinion, i think that building specialised facilities to encahnce top athletes potential is essential and its such a positive development, i also think that any sports player must have a good body and eat healthy food, because a good physique can improve movement,stamina and strength etc specially in the sports that depend alot on the body as an exmaple football, basketball, table tennis, swimming etc, and healthy food helps the athlete to achieve the physique that he wants and give him even more power and activity.
builiding specialised facilities is important because they will train them specificly on certain things in order to make them the best, also they can focus on the athletes alone they are not going to be disturbed by people, every athlete with his coach, and that place only will be for the proffessnial athletes, as an example in table tennis professional players play in their clubs because they have the best enviroment to be better, they have amazing equipment such as the table the racket etc, and they have the coaches all over the place, and they can play with the players because they are all professional athletes.
additionally those player have to be very fit, all of the top players are in extremely good shape their legs are built of metal in order to help them move quick in the table and the muscules helps with stamina if they are strong they can play more without getting tired.
so yes the facilities are very helpful and crucial to reach the top and they have to follow a specific diet from the professional coaches.",6.5

today children are spending much more time watching tv compared to the past. why do you think this happens? is this a positive or a negative change?,"a trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more tv than ever before. one of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. this tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.the latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching tv, compared to the past. with interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the tv. a recent survey showed that tv addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. this increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.this trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. more time spent watching tv adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. for instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. however, tv can also be used in a positive way. it is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.in conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their tv screens. this can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of tv, but parents have the power to make tv time useful and beneficial for their children.",8.0

in 1998, once you entered the museum you would first encounter the entrance/ exit and the thickets shop. on the left, there was a temporary exhibition room and on the right, there was a shop, the bathroom and a bags and coat hanger.
at that time the museum had three permanent exhibition rooms: one on the left, next to the temporary exhibition room, and two on the right, adjacent to the shop and wc.
separating 2 exhibition rooms, at the top of the plan, there was a cafe. all the spaces mentioned surrounded a central garden.
similar to 1998, in 2008, people would find a ticket shop in the space designated as an entrance and exit. however, on the left, now is a permanent exhibition room, whereas on the right there's a shop and a bags and coat hanger. the museum still possesses three permanent exhibition rooms, all of them on the right side of the building.
on the left side, adjacent to the shop and hanger there's a temporary exhibition room and next to it a restaurant. at the top of the plan, there's a cafe and a bathroom next to the restaurant and one of the permanent exhibition rooms, respectively.

write about the following topic.in some parts of the world people try to find out one's own family history. why do people do this? do you think it is a positive or negative?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"at present, discovering one`s own family history is becoming more and more commom. in the following paragraphs, i will present the motives why people do that and the reason i strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.
probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. one of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.
moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. when people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.
as mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. one and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.
to summarize, one may try to find out about their family history for two main motives, one being about their health and the other one about feeling part of a community. both reasons are important and have positive impacts on one`s life.",5.5

a country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.to what extent do you agree or disagree?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"there are some beliefs that when there is a mixture of nationalities, a country can improve it's development. in my opinion, i believe these statement can be both true and false at the same time.
mixture of nationalities may promote country's development as some particular nationalities are more proficient in one particular activity than another nationalities. for example, jamaican has a superior body in running. they are the whipping out all the gold medals in running. each nationalities has it's own strongness, so they can help each other to develop the country.
on the other hand, development in the country may not be fast when different nationalities are in one country due to the conflicts between the locals and the foreigners about culture and language differences. such conflicts may rise and result in slower development as there are going to be communication difficulties between the local citizens and foreigners. in addition, local citizens may be annoyed of foreign people taking away their jobs, creating more anger between each other. to exemplify, usa is one of the country that has multinational population. usa has developed a lot over a past decade and is a leader of technology but at the same time, it contains many social issues such as race hatred. usa is expected to develop less compared to other countries for many reasons, but mainly due to intelligent and competitive foreign experts leaving their country.
in conclusion, i believe different nationalities will play a critical role in the country's development. however, the government should educate their local people to understand and respect other country's cultures in order to maximise the productivity in their country.",7.5

write about the following topic.some universities now offer their courses on the internet so that people can study online.is this a positive or negative development?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"nowadays, many universities allow people to follow some courses and study totally online. in my opinion, this way of studing has both positive and negative aspects. this essay will argue why studing online can be unproductive for people.
the first reason why studing online is not good for a student is that is easier for him to lost the concentraiton during a lecture. for example, last year beacuse of the pandemic period, all students had to get class online, including me. it was a terrible year, because i stayed at home all the time and became very difficult listening lectures due to lot of things that capture my attention during lessons.
the other reason why getting class on the internet is a negative development is that the direct interaction between people is absent. i feel that this is the biggest drawback, because students are always alone in their room and they could become unsocial over the time. by contrast, the social life is important for everyone, because it help people to grow and share good and bad moment of the life. in addition, i think that is also important the dialoge with the teacher.
in conclusion, studing online can be a good solution for some people who need to stay at home and want to study at university, but in general it's a negative thing. in fact, is important for students to stay in a class with the teacher and other classmates to be concentrate during a lesson and to have the possibility to talk face to face with other people.",6.0
"ielts essay, topic: some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss)","some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. discuss both views and give your own opinion.there is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. from a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. others, however, believe the opposite.there are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. the most common reason is automation. driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. as a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. with each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. this increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.however, i firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. the most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. for instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. as a result, food has become more affordable and available. finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.in conclusion, i strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.this essay adequately covers all parts of the task. the ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. the paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay. a good range of vocabulary and the writer’s fluency are evident. there are no spelling errors and very few mistakes in word choice and grammar, most sentences are error-free. the essay is likely to get band 8 in ielts.",8.0
"write about the following topic.music is played in every society and culture in the world today.some people think that music brings only benefits to individuals and societies. others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both.discuss both these views and give your own opinion.give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","there are only a few things that many societies and cultures have in common, and one of these is music. despite its universality, however, there is a controversy pertaining to its actual effects on not only people but on societies as well. while its benefial effects is acknowledged, some people still believe that it has a negative influence on people and societies. in my opinion, the benefits of music to both individuals and societies outweighs its detremental effects. in this essay, however, i will discuss both points of views.
to start with, the fact that some people consider music a bad influcence is understandable especially when considering idolisation of musicians among young people. for example, the effect that the current world wide sensation korean boy band, bts, have on a lot of young people is unexplanable. many youngsters have idolised this group to the extent where it affects their education and life in general. definately, parents of children affected by this group will not be happy with their activities and will therefore develop negative feelings towards them. furthermore, as many more young people lose focus because of their love for music and musicians, the society suffers in the long run because these people are less likely to be productive members of the society.
moving on, music also has a number of positive effects on people and societies. the first being that it is actually a lucrative source of livelihood for those involved and it also creats job opportunities. to explain further, musicians do not work alone, they need to be managed, they need a stylist, a make-up artist, song writers, graphic designers, to name a few and all these positions create an opportunity for young people to fill them. furthermore, music is a good way to relax and calm one's mind. this method is even employed in therapy to aide the treatment or management of some anxiety disorders. lastly, considering its effect on societies, the contribution of the music industry to a nations economy cannot be overlooked. its contribution has always been tremendous and many times, important political figures have awarded musicians that have played a huge role in not only the economy of the country but her public image as well. for instance, very recently, the president of south korea awarded bts for their contribution, through their music, to the growth and international recognition of the country.
in conclusion, despite the controversy, in my opinion, the effect of music has more pros than cons on both individuals and societies because the industry not only creates job opportunities, music can also be used for the management of some mental health disorders and finally, it contributes a lot to a country's economy.",6.0

write about the following topic.consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. to what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? what measures can be taken to protect them?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"in recent years, the advancement of cutting-edge technology has been elevating the quality of life of customers worldwide. however, the issue at hand is, some consumers face difficulties in choosing products from companies because there are surging numbers of advertisements from rival companies. this essay will examine the extent to where customers are impacted by advertisements and suggest viable methods to protect customers.
to begin with, i think that customers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent because their emotional decision-making as buyers are affected. although some consumers believe that watching a mcdonald advertisement on tv does not neccesarily encourage them to purchase foods from mcdonalds, continously watching mcdonald advetisements in a repetitive manner will subconsciously revert the customer's attention to order foods from mcdonalds when they are hungry during late nights. in 2016, a study from harvard university by professor oak mentioned that 75% of consumers who view the same imageries of advertising will began implementing it as a part of their lives. as a result, they become obese. another point worth mentioning is, rival companies will tend to create an illusion of trust towards their products. if a loyal colgate customer, a toothpaste brand, was convinced by oral b through advertisements, another toothpaste brand that their product was better, they will potentially choose oral b and rely on it permanently despite the fact that they have more flaws in their product. hence, the customers will become emotionally manipulated.
on the contrary, there are a number of profound methodology to prevent increasing numbers of advertisements from influencing customers. one of the most notable ones is, the government should limit the number of advertisements published. although an advertising company may lose attention from customers due to lack of the marketing, many customers will be able to focus on lesser advertisements that wastes significantly less of their time. therefore, they will be able to enjoy more time watching the movie or series that they love. moreover, another important solution that the government should investigate advertisement products displayed online. for instance, in some countries, baby milk powder was replaced with dangerous chemicals that resulted in food poisoning in babies. this caused severe trauma to consumers that re mianly family members worldwide. by implementing stricter control towards advertisement products, customers will be able to reap the rewards of the best products and move on with their life. yales university states that by enhancing the quality of advertising campaigns despite the rivalry betweem companies, customers will be able to protect themselves from manipulation from marketing schemes. therefore, customers will be safe from misleading products.
in conclusion, while i believe that consumers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent and create an illusion of trust towards their products, there are also viable measures to protect customers such as the government limiting the number of advertisements shown and investigating advertisement products displayed online.",8.0
news editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. what factors do you think influence their decisions? do we become used to bad news? would it be better if more good news was reported?,". there are two factors that influence their decisions. the first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. for example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. it be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. on the contrary, and politicians may never read news about james blunt or keira knightley. therefore, what influences news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.the second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? the answer is . in the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. so that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. or else, they may lose their customers. none of editors wants that bleak future.the type of news is also an important consideration. whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. it is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. we can’t deny that bad things happen on earth day by day. however, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. we want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. as a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. and the happiest people are, of course, news editors.in my view it would be better if more good news reported. bad news makes us good news makes us happy. there should an an equal amount of good and bad news. in that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. we should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.",7.0

first, one of the initial impacts of such activity is when heavy logging instruments compress the soil, making it hard and baked. thus, rain water may run off and eventually resulting in flooding. secondly, with clear cutting of forests, there is a decrease in roots that hold the top soil in it. this will lead to soil erosion.
moreover, deforestaion is belived to rise the likelihood of burning, either delibrately or accidentally. as waste food from logging is destroyed, some micro-organisms that feed on it might vanish. other species get in the field, causing a degradation of vegetation. this could be also a result of soil erosion or an increase of drought. all of these events are responsible for less biodiversity. finally, a decrease in plants means less moisture to air, less precipitation and more exacerbation of drought.
overall, as is shown by this chart, the deforestation process has substantial repersussions on nature through various ways. unless any decrease of this detrimental activity, nature would witness flooding, soil erosions, less biodiversity and severe drought.",7.5
write about the following topic.the most important function of music is that it helps people reduce stress. to what extent do you agree or disagree?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"in general, music plays a vital role in our everyday work life. it is said to be the purest form of art but it is often claimed that the main purpose of music is to make people feel relaxed.
music addresses our psychological, mental, and spiritual needs giving us relaxation. without any doubt, it is a sure thing that there is no day when a person does not listen to music not even once and this is really helpful for them to reduce their stress after a tiring day at work and our brain produces some healthy endorphins.
this makes them mentally refreshed and also intensifies their moods. for example, i am really passionate about easygoing soul music or folk songs and listen to them with the help of several singing apps. as a result, it soothes my mind and helps to maintain a good vibe. in addition, music has proven its healing power in the medical industry to cure various diseases. such as listening to the verses of the quran is being used to cure many psychological disorders.
furthermore, a variety of authors of songs write them with their emotions when they are happy or sad. people who face similar challenges or situations like in the lyrics of the song resonate with it and that they are not the only persons with the same problems. nature sings to every single sound that is heard in our surroundings like the chirping of birds, and the sound of heavy rain, and even when a glass is broken there is some sort of music.
to conclude, i think that the most important function of music is to explain life, its beauty, meaning, and feeling. and indeed in relaxing one's mind.",6.0
"the use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","corporal punishment used to be a very popular method in education all around the globe. in the last century there is an opposite trend, which leads to bans on any physical punishment. i believe any corporal punishment should be against the law in schools and any other facilities.
recent studies show, that violence is neither most effective nor useful method in education. according to the scientists, any type of physical punishment creates a negative psycological pattern. students focus on fear and put extra effort into learning things by hard. but students don't use this knowledge or keep it after upcomming test or exam.
besides, these methods harm students and reduce creativity in the future. scientists say, that physically abused kids develop psycological disorders in the future life. this leads to an increased suicide rate, higher chance of depression, and lower happiness.
most importantly, physical punishment doesn't address the core of the problem. there are several reasons for a low school performance: a low interest in the topic, a bad explanation, or a low quality of life. to increase students performance we have to focus on quality of education first. but there are some good news. humanity made a huge progress since internet and youtube are much more accessable nowdays.
in general, there is not a single piece of evidence which support physical punishment. it's a method from the past that should not be used nowdays. corporal punishment leads to lower performance, psycological disorders, and doesn't solve any real problem. this is why it shouldn't be allowed anywhere in the world.",8.0
the picture below shows how a hot balloon works. summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features.you should write at least 150 words.,"the presented diagram describes the operation of a heated balloon. at first glance, it is evident that a hot balloon contains three major components, including a basket, a burner, and an envelope system.
a basket is an appropriate spot where individuals stand beneath a hot balloon. besides, a burner is a piston situated on top of the basket. it combines propane and air to generate flame and heated air. the rope connects the burner and skirt, and it allows the envelope system to be linked with the bottom portion.
the vertical lines on the balloon itself are referred to as gores, whereas the horizontal lines are defined as panels. a self-sealing flap is labelled as a parachute valve in which located on the top of the balloon, enabling hot air to flow out at a consistent rate.
in other words, if hot air is lighter than cool air, it would rise when the burner produces a flame. hence, the hot balloon would employ this power to take off.",6.5
some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.discuss the advantages and disadvantages.give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"recently, there have been several laws to control the noise made by neighbors and surrounded places close to people's accommodations. some people think that these laws should be strict and effectively enforced by authorities in order to avoid any small noise that might disturb the private comfortability. others believe that such laws might entail a few disadvantages and negative repercussions on people's lives. in this essay i will be trying to count possible advantages and disadvantages of this legislation.
it is well known that home is the ideal place to rest, relax and bring positive energies to the residents. thus, noise made by the neighbors might threat these unique blessings we are used to enjoying in our houses. moreover, many people perform vital actions within their homes that require silence and high concentration, such as studying, reading and other forms of creative activities. therefore, governments' duty is to guarantee that these activities are performed without any disturbance, by making specific laws to control the amount of noise and ensure optimal quality of life for all the citizens. in addition, if there were not laws to control the noise, we would encounter many more fights and inconvenient incidents among neighbors.
on the other hand, there is another aspect to be considered. calling for strict laws and total preventing of any sounds produced by adjacent people could sounds unacceptable. people still have the basic right to arrange meetings and parties at their homes, and others need to listen to music as a vital action for their soul and wellbeing.
to conclude, in order to find the balance between the advantages and the disadvantages, governments might design flexible laws to meet the people's needs. for example, in some cities, noise preventing is valid only in specific periods of the day, periods in which most of the people supposed to rest and need silence.",7.0

the process starts after the rain drops slip at the roof of the houses and then enter the pipes which is connected to the under ground system for water treatment. as these drops flow in the drain, they directly move towards the water filter. after the filtering process ends, water is then passed to a storage where it can be stored and then transfered to the next procedure. when the water slides from the storage and moves to the water treatment tank, a small device at the top of the tank produces chemicals in order to clear the water from any additional wastes or bacteria that the water filter was not able to clear before. finally, the loop ends when the water is treated and moves back to the pipes which is the connection between the water treatment system and the houses. people can now have a drinkable water in different sections in their homes.
to sum up, the process of producing a filtering water starts with the pipes that collects the rain water and also ends with pipes that delivers the drinking water after it passed all the treatment procedures within the under ground system.",7.0
the number of advertisements for charities on television and the internet seems to be increasing. what is causing this? is this a positive or a negative development?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.you should write at least 250 words.,"it indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the internet seems to be increasing. there can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.one explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. this can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. the increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of ‘street salespeople’, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.a second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. if these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. the increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. people might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.if the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people’s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. if it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. in addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.there could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development.",9.0
the tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"in recent years, news reports on tv programs and news papers tend to focus on incidents and emergencies rather than positive developments. in japan, because of this phenomenon, many people are influenced this country might be more dangerous than they thought. i disagree with these tendencies and should focus on more positive developments, including entertainment.
to go into detail, in japan, once people turn on the tv in the morning. people face often face some news reports about a murder case, who were murdered, who is the criminal, and background details. in addition, there are more than 5 channels on tv, these all 5 channels broadcast the same incident at the same time. the japanese government might take the control of media in order to agitate people to keep their attention on safety. it might be important to some extent, but it is not necessarily a good influence on people's mind if they were required to watch such a fierce, and negative incident every morning.
in contrast, when it comes japanese crime rate, and case. they reached a peak of 2014, and keep decreasing until now. the cases are not significant derrence, compared with a few dacase ago. in addition, almost japanese crimes tend to be petty crimes, such as thefts, frauds, shop lifting, and so on. in terms of the murder case, japan is ranked as the 5th safest country among 160 countries in 2017. this means that the more media reported the savage crimes, people misunderstand japanese society is getting more dangerous than a few decades ago.
finally, it is understandable to report such a heavy incident to some extent. on the other hand, they should also report positive and attractive news, such as tourism, especially inbound sales figures has been increasing and contributing to japanese economic growth, and some japanese athletes have been successful in mlb(major league baseball), and football. this news must be more fascinating for japanese people to encourage their own national identity.
in conclusion, this is not a black-and-white issue. but it might be more beneficial for people's minds to be positive. if some heavy incidents happened, the japanese government should restrict tv companies to broadcasting only one channel, or limit the time shorter.",6.5

"write about the following topic.to meet the growing need for food to support an increasing population, a country should make use of edible insects as a food source. however, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. what are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. as such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. however, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. as the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.
i have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, i would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. he intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. however, he may be correct! for individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.
i have tried an octopus for the first time when i was around 20 years old - as i was curious about this dish called takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. it was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but i likely will not go back to it. all in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again.",6.0

as a results any major city in the world is experiencing very dense traffic.this trend is now also being noticed in smaller cities too.
in order to reduce the amount of traffic, people should reduce their travel to work, education and shopping. at work that could mean working from home whenever it is possible, limitate the domestic and international business trip when not absolutely needed. online studying could be generalized when the fied of study does not requires physical practice nor specific facilities. since online shopping is becoming trendy we could change our habits and go on the web rather than in malls or in town in order to shop. the movement restrictions imposed during the covid-19, especially during the lockdown demonstrated that this is possible. however, during that period, most of us realized that this lack of mobility and travel freedom is not the best and is a heavy constraint, both personal and profesional.
shouldn't we look for other alternatives in order to reduce the traffic ?
it is now well known buy all that using the public transportations is a great way to reduce the traffic. it is usually faster than using a private car and it is more eco-friendly. even if it also has disadvantages such as the lack of timetable flexibilty, the lack of privacy, sometimes the price... it should be our prefered way of transportation whenever possible.
carpooling is another great way to reduce traffic. wether it is for daily trips to work or week-end escapades, that is a great way to contribute to a limitate the numbers of vehicules on the road. maybie governments should find incitative measures such as the one on some u.s highways, where carpools have access to express lanes while the private drivers who are alone in their cars have more restrictions.
even if our society is evoluting towards a very internet connected world where you can work, study and shop remotely, i think people might limitate their movement but won't stop travelling, whether it is long or short distance.
instead of keeping selling millions ( or maybie trillions of cars every year on earth ) government as well as individuals should rather rethink the way they move and transport themselves.",6.0

secondly, by empowering players of sharing tasks with the team, both empathy and discipline will be developed.
nevertheless, the most common shortcoming of playing in a team is that often one’s overall performance can be restrained by constantly hewing to a strict tactics which leave no room for bold or creative moves, stifling any prospective talent on the rise.

although the spirit of challenge is equally through the roof in comparison with team sports, the absence of mates to confront with may, in the long run, leads the individual player to become decidedly more reclusive and self-reliant.

firstly, creating competitive work environment might encourage employees to work harder as they can get a reward such as money. however, exposing staff to this competitive situation frequently can weaken the unity of employees and cooperation with each other as a team. i believe that rewarding system for empolyees should be a yearly event to celebrate the end of the year.
most of all, there are alternative ways to encourage staff to be more effective at work. employers should plan a regular gathering for employees. for example, the company can organise sports events, dinner parties or tea breaks. this can help staff communicate each other as well as build a close relationship; which are neccessary for effective and creative work environment.

in some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,"over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.
it is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. a classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. when juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. this is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.
in spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. a common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. this is exemplified by thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. in addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.
in conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working.",7.5

"the diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.","the schemes compare two different methods of defence for homes that can be easily affected by floods. overall, they show flood protection with and without a stopbank, while the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures.
the first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. the stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks. nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of ‘internal ponding.’
if it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. in this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. the height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. this measure is called the ‘freeboard.’",7.5

in many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). why? is this a positive or negative development?,"increasing in interests about money happened in many countries worldwide. obviously, aguements about wage and income has become popular topics for people. this essay will demonstrate reasons behide this and some possible consequences followed the statement.
to begin, in the modern world, social media plays a major role in which people, younger generation in particular, communicate with others. this can be a dominant cause leading to daily conversations about financial issues. for example, a plenty of contents posted on digital platforms, such as facebook and instagram, are related to financial knowledge. this perhaps normalize the topics about financial to be more acceptable than in the past.
furthermore, luxury products have become an indicator of social status for younger generation. with tons of advertisements involved in every kinds of medias, people tend to spend their wealth on artificial things more and more. for instance, i experienced with a few individuals saving over a half of their monthly income to be able to purchase a high-end watch.
although having converstions about money might help people to understand deeper about money management and how improve themselves to get higher wage, this could lead to overspendings which could have a huge negative effect.
in conclusion, it seems to me that a widely used of social media and advertisements of luxury products are two major causes of a rising in popurlarity of talking about money. on one hand, the situation can help equip people with better knowledge about money management and self-improvement. on the other hand, daily discussions about money has a potential to raise an importance of external artificial objects.",6.0

"people often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.what is your opinion about an ideal societyhow can we create an ideal society?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","it is no doubt the truth that the majority of people want to live in a society where they can derive a sense of satisfaction. while people are ceaselessly struggling to improve society to meet their needs, there is almost always some problems or issues that remain and keep society from being better. in this essay, i try to examine the reason why it is a highly challenging and even impossible task to create an ideal society and give some measures that might be helpful to mitigate the situation.
the first step is to understand why the goal of an ideal society is tough to achieve. one of the most apparent reasons is that it is nearly not possible to give an explicit definition of ideality. since the desire of each person can be extremely different and individual, their expectations of what an excellent society should look like are immensely varied and sometimes incompatible with each other. for instance, some people wish to have a society of fewer foreign immigrants because of the eventual rise in crime and the more intensive competitiveness in the job market, while others insist that a multicultural society certainly brings vast amounts of merits to the future. another obvious reason is in terms of the difficulty of realizing the requirements. a prime example is eliminating discrimination against gender or sexual orientation. although a lot of related laws have been introduced to protect the vulnerable population from being discriminated against, this issue remains one of the most significant concerns that people have and need to face every day.
despite the complexity and challenges of creating the ideal society for everyone, there is still a large number of things that can be done to enhance the expectations of people toward the society where they live. in my opinion, an ideal society includes at least great tolerance. i believe that education, especially in primary school and kindergarten, plays an essential role in teaching how to treat others with respect, which benefits the tolerant atmosphere in society significantly. one measure that government should leastwise take into account is to fund the more meaningful projects at the school, which publicize and advocate the value of fairness, justice, and kindness.
to sum up, although it might not be possible to create a society that satisfies the whole population regarding the huge diversity of attitudes people hold toward the key consideration of an ideal society, there is still highly necessary to make every effort to make it a better one for all.",8.0

on one hand, old people are limited by the population which let the people in the same place communicate through symbols to be aware of enemies. towards generations, these symbols turned into history. as a result, people think that it is just a piece of art by the old people. in fact, some of these are from scientists and have been written as a symbol. moreover, till now those shapes meant nothing to us or are just small pieces of information.
on the other hand, these days the government take a step forward and is trying hard to clarify those stones and what it means, in addition, some historical centers have scientists studying the old tools in order to have an idea from studying that symbols. for instance, tomes addison one of his achievement was the discovery of the light lamp which we are used to living with it. therefore, this exploration comes from studying old history. in other words, each generation is capable to help the following generation.

some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"regarding the suggestions that governments should offord the tuition subsidies to cover the cost of full classes, i could only partially agree due to various drawbacks derived from policies as such.
to begin with, higher educational levels is essential for young individuals in poor families reverse their situation, not only for themselves but for their families. in this case, governments have obligations to ensure the right of them to pursue higher education without the financial concerns. for example many university students nowadays have more than one part-time jobs since they need to support themselves financially, which left no time for them to concentrate on studies.
on the other hand, despite free ethic education could benefit a great number of students in need, the huge costs to maintain a functional educational institution should not be overlooked, by removing tuition fee in universities completely, it could derives various downsides, including lower quality of education and slower progresses of local constructions and developments caused by the shortage of budgets. take the uk as an example, private schools are able to provide more educational materiols and professional educators, compared to public schools, which have high tendency classes, and outdated teaching equipments.
to summerrise, in my perspective, the right for students to study in universities is crucial, since it could not only cultivates talents who are able to contribute to societies, but allows them to bring their families out of poverty. however, people should not be ignoranced for the negative affects derived from removing tuition fee entirely, such as poor quality of teaching. therefore, i could only partially agree with such opinions.",6.0

write about the following topic.the issue of gay marriage remains controversial. some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. should gay marriage be legal?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"some people argue that gay marriage it is a trend that might negatively affect society. controversially, some others believe that same-sex marriages are natural and people have the right to choose this kind of marriage. this essay discusses why gay marriage should not be defined as a trend but regarded as a people's right, thus as a legal marriage.
during the last few years, several arguments arose against or in favour of same-sex marriage. for decades, people believed that gay people should not be allowed to get married as it was considered against the traditional image of a family. for example, same-sex people wouldn't be able to love and care for a child as a traditional family could. the belief behind this thought is related to the patriarchal educational concept where a child needs to grow in the presence of a mother and a father. thus, same-sex relations are considered not natural by some people. considering the definition of love and what caring for someone involves in, isn't indicated that same-sex people cannot feel and express love to each other and care for someone. love is a feeling that goes beyond the gender. as such, people have the right to love and get married.
,
hence, due to the presence of such a patriarchal belief in most of the world's countries, gay marriage isn't a legal right yet. in a world where people express the need to be more democratic, politically correct and free from biases and discrimination, same-sex marriage should be globally legalised. as such, a change of mindset might be needed. for example, people should begin to see marriage as an expression of love rather than a right and moral action to procreate.
to sum up, while for some people same-sex marriage is only a trend that should could impact the society, for some others, gay marriage it is a natural expression of love. thus, marriage should be allowed regardless the gender and people's sexual-orientation. govemrnts. should support and legalised same-sex marriage.",6.5

it is understandable that people also think that dependence on computers in teaching may be detrimental to students. the students may become lazy and may not necessarily want to use their brains to calculate or understand things because the computer has already done that for them. also using computers to learn in the school environment is also just adding to screen time for the learners; they are already being exposed to lots of wrong things at home adding school to it may not neceesarily the best option.
personally, students have a lot to learn using computers but truthfully speaking most of them already have the technological know how when it comes to using computers and if they actually want to learn more about how to use them, they can do so at home using the popular learning sites, it doesnt necessarily have to be introduced into the school learning system.
in conclusion,computers are currently the foundation of the modern world and have their advantages and disadvantages, if they are put to the right use at the appropriate place and time, its benefits are beyond measure.",7.5

overall, it is clearly can be seen that the proccess consists of five sequential stages starting from collecting rain drops to ultimatley be usable in houses.
firstly, rain water slides into the drain from the house roof, through drains, rain water is shortly transffered to water filter, there where water is purified from pollutants and undesirable substances. after that, the filtered water goes through a pipe that leads to a huge square-shaped storage then immediatley go through another pipe to be treated. the water treatment includs chemical substances that are pumped to be mixed with water in order to be completly clean. after the box is filled to the top, purified water will be pumped to the house and ultimatley be utilized by human consumption.",5.5
the diagram below shows how ethanol fuel is produced from corn.summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.,"during the covid-19 pandemic, countless measures have been implemented to reduce transmission amongst citizens. the use of hand sanitizers has been one of them, but what is it made of? ethanol is a common disinfecting agent found in cleaning products, which originates from corn. here's a nine-step manufacturing method of how this alcohol is produced from that supercrop.
in the first third of production, the maize is harvested, stored and ground up during milling. first, farmers collect ripened ears from fields, and then place them in bins and other containers. these are then crushed into a powder to increase the surface area, hence increasing the potential yield of ethanol created.
steps four to six involve boiling, brewing and filtration. the powder produced in the milling process is mixed with water and boiling takes four hours. once it is done, the mixtue is left to stand for 48 hours, allowing fermentation to occur, and unprocessed ethanol be created. after this two-day step, the mixture is filtered to separate the unpurified ethanol from the solid by-product.
lastly, the liquid raw product is distilled, packaged in various containers and shipped to retailers. filtration is carried out for five hours to increase the purity of the ethanol. afterwards, the final product is packaged and stored until it is transported to stores, where we can purchase it for our daily use and protection.
many important people such as farmers, scientist and transporters assist in the manufacturing process of ethanol and we thank them for creating this essential product.",8.5

on the one hand, it seems beneficial to engage in activities that keeps the mind slightly engaged during our leisure period. this is basically due to the fact that some mind consciousness might be lost when idle.sluggishness may thereforeset in when required to partake in activities that requires full attention. hence playing chess and games might help maintain ones' awareness during a less busy period. secondly, getting involved in basic activities like reading and surfing the internet during these free period could also help improve ones intellectual capacity and also overall general knowledge that could well be very beneficial to improving the entire state of the mind.
on the other hand, those who say its essential to rest the mind after extensive period of activities might have a point.this is because resting the mind will help recharge ones' batteries and general condition of the mind. take for instance, a tech inclined engineer that uses his mind and brain a lot to profer solutions to complex problems. a liitle period to be calm and relaxed will be of utmost importance to alleviate a potential mind and thoughts exhaustion.

some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. do you agree or disagree?,"nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . there are two following reasons to support for my opinion. i refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group a’ and the other group – as ‘group b’.firstly, at school and university, what group a gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. you must have experience. this is what group a . although in the third or fourth year at university, group a can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. and the real job is still very strange to them. after graduating, without experience, group a students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. on the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. therefore, group a students can contribute less than group b who have the two most important things: skills and experience.secondly, as group a students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. moreover, many companies which employ people in group a have to train them from ground-up. these companies take this cost from group a’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. so, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group b members are more loyal and effective workers. they also have useful experience and skills. besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group a. as the result, group b gets more benefits absolutely.in conclusion, i think a student should travel or work before going to the university. that way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.",7.0
"many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. to what extent do you agree or disagree?","the cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. it is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. in my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.if people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. it would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. however, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.people enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. if that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.to sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. a conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.",8.0
"write about the following topic.in many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.discuss both these views and give your own opinion.give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","in numerous countries, few individuals earn a considerable income. despite the outrageous salary that people could have, many consider that government ought to submit a limit of wages. however, others believe that is profitable for their nation.
thinking to all poverty that there are in the world, i can understand why some individuals estimate to not allow indecent wages. in my opinion, a larger number of people who earn significant salaries always waste their money into useless luxuries to show off. however, when we can see some household which have numerous jobs to keep the wolf from the door, it seems obvious that governments should impose restrictions on income. in addition, even if individuals sometimes deserve their wages, if government had their billions which are in their bank accounts, it would help millions of inhabitants for numerous issues. it could benefit to the general interest, namely, to reduce starve, poverty or even maybe find a cure for cancer.
nevertheless, i would say that individuals deserve their salaries because most of the time, people who earn a considerable living create employment such as chief executive officer. thanks to their ingenuity and their leadership, this small number of geniuses build corporation which give to thousands of persons a full-time job. indeed, citizens must not forget that everyone pay taxes hence, for example, if a businessman had a heavy income, he would pay higher taxes than everybody. furthermore, this gap between salaries could also be justified due to different level of studies or responsibility which lead to distinct income.
to conclude, even if in each country, there are heterogenous wages with a huge gap, each view is completely understandable. however, thinking to submit restrictions on salaries, could lead to a reduction of country’s development.",6.0
"society is based on rules and laws. if individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. to what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","it is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. it means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. i strongly agree with this point of view as i am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. in this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.
basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. for example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.
laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. all criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. this way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. in this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'
from the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. they form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb people’s well-being.",7.0
universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.to what extent do you agree or disagree?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"regarding education, gender equity is crucial. some people argue that universities should enrol an equal number of men and women in every field. personally, i totally agree with that statement because i believe it is fairer and it is better for the society.
the main reason male and female students should be equal in number is that it would be more equitable. in fact, numerous studies have stated that their brains are not working the same way. in other words, their cognitive capacities are different, so they should not compete with each other for university admissions. it does not mean that a gender is more intelligent than the other. for example, men are generally known to have a better spacial orientation, while women's ability to memorize is superior. similarly, their physical capacities are not the same either, and that is why men and women do not compete against each other in sports competitions.
another reason to separate sexes regarding university admissions is because it ensure a better distribution of gender among the labor market. broadly speaking, it is well known that males work, in their life, more hours that females. this is principally due to the fact that women take more maternity leave than men. unfortunately, it can consequently create a problem in the society.for example, nowadays, women represent the majority of students in medicine as they have better grades in high school. as a result, there is not enough working staff in hospitals when they quit to take care of their families. the same situation applies to every field with a majority of women such as jobs in health services.
in conclusion, i reiterate that there should be an equal number of male and female students enrolled in universities because it would be more equitable and ensure a better repartition of genders among different fields of employment.",7.0

compare to swiming, a group sport like soccer game need 22 players participate into the field. average soccer player have very powerful core strenth, in order to compete in this match, soccer player need to wear certain protection to prevent from injury such as foot pad to reduce the impact from side kick from other players and ankel protector. undoubtly, soccer players have most strong body among many sports. however, they are the group of people most likely get injuryed more frequently.
sport also can build trust and friendship between people. in this aspect, both individual sports and group sports are proven that partipating in group games or competing with another player on a 1v1 match can increase the improvement of sportsmanship between people. like olympic motto, ""stonger, faster and higher"", a good sport can bring people together and compete each other in a fair and friendly enviornment. however, individual sport may get boring faster than group sports due to lack of competition.

there is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher.what might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? how should we deal with this problem?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"despite knowing about the adverse effects of climate change, human activities have been highly responsible for global warming for decades. this essay will discuss the main causes of temperature rising including the excessive use of fossil fuels and plastic pollution. this essay will further suggest solutions to these problems including decreasing the consumption of fossil fuels and reducing the dumping of waste in the sea.
most people are guzzling fossil fuels, churning out greenhouse gases and messing with our planet's climate like there's no tomorrow. for instance, driving to the grocery store burns a certain amount of fuel, resulting in an increase in carbon footprint. the combustion of fossil fuels emits co2, which in turn traps heat in the atmosphere, hence making it the primary contributor to global warming. moreover, dumping plastic in oceans deprive phytoplanktons of sunlight. as a result, the planktons are not able to carry out photosynthesis, a process that removes co2 and releases oxygen, which leads to disruption of the world's carbon cycle and ultimately makes the planet warmer. thus human activities that contribute to an escalation in co2 emissions are the prime causes of a rise in global temperature.
substituting fossil fuels with other renewable energy sources and reducing plastic usage are both critical to mitigating this phenomenon. for example, people should install solar lights in their homes instead of led bulbs. we should also curb the buying of processed or canned foods and should always take our own paper bags while going  grocery shopping to prevent the use of plastic bags. furthermore, using public transportations rather than private vehicles for commuting would significantly alleviate our carbon footprint. therefore, if humans shift to renewable and recyclable materials then it would drastically minimise the temperature rising issues.
to conclude, people's actions that change the environment have a negative impact on the global climate. however, we can substantially lessen it by curbing fossil fuels and plastic usage.",8.0
write about the following topic.the issue of gay marriage remains controversial. some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. should gay marriage be legal?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"it is a critical topic whether the society should accept gay marriage and legalized this kind of marriage. this especially sensative to some people with religious background or society with strong religious background.
some argue that if the society accepts gay marriage, the traditional value and concept of marriage would be affected. the influences are deep and negative. for example, gay marriage is contradict to the nature and could not has next generation, in the long term, leads the reduction of population and harms the growth of economic. in addition, the society has to consider about legal issue if gay marriage is accept . for example, if an legal gay family could adapt children? who can prossess the asset and wealth from the gay couple?
however, the trend for supporting gay marriage has increased in recent decades, probably because of the equal-right campaign rapidly spreading in the world. many people state that marriage is a matter of two adults, as long as these two adults make their decision, there is no any harm to other , and the society. some even believe same-sex marriage is also a nautre development which is long appearing in human history. moreover, there is no evidence showing gay marriage would harm the society , rather to promote a multi-cultural, a society should accept different races, nationalties and gay people.
in my opinion, we should open our mind to accept gay marriage but we should also respect some religious person' s willingness. whether gay marriage should be legal is a technical subject that i am not the right person to comment. however, i strongly hope people could respect others with different sexual preference, communication and understanding people with different values are the key for a harmony society. we have to admit that people have their right to choose their marriage in various ""types"" .",6.5
write about the following topic.it is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.to what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"as society becomes more and more saturated with technology, traditional cultures are losing their roles in society. the compatibility of technology and traditions are often debated where some suggest it is possible, whereas, others argue it is not. in this essay, i will discuss both perspectives and conclude by saying how and why it is almost impossible.
since people usually appreciate limited ways of living, it is challenging for both conventions and technology to co-exist. they will usually choose one method or another but not both at the same time. for instance, a company would have to focus on using human labour or advanced machineries to produce a product. the incompatibility may not be obvious at first but as technology develops futher, use of machines will increase but employment will decrease. furthermore, technology is often considered to be more convenient and faster by many people. work can be done more efficiently so workers will start to abandon the old ways of living or working.
in contrast, it might be possible for two values to work along in society due to different tastes of various people. traditional cultures are usually appreciated by old generation such as grandparents, meanwhile, new generation prefers technology in their life. for example, grandparents can read newspaper while grandchildren watch tv or play games during family time. moreover, although it is hard for a company to use both at the same time, it is not totally impossible. if the number of machines is controlled during production, human labour and machines can work together to maximise productivity by covering up each other's disadvantages.
all in all, even though traditional values and technology can be compatible theoratically, it is indeed difficult to compromise the use between two in real life. ergo, people would have to beware of the risk of losing traditional cultures, if at all.",7.0
some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. discuss both views and give your opinion.,"nowadays, due to increasing of crime rate, some people tend to think of the best way to decline crime is giving a longer prison sentences. however, some criticisms probably believe that there should have much better ways to decrease crime. in my opinion, that is true to some extent for this statement. that means the prison sentences may be necessary, but i perfer the other ways such as education and detenion center rather than the prison sentences, especially for minors.
firstly, it is possible to said that increasing the punishment would decline the crime in the society. considering the fact that most of citizens afraid to lose their freedom as a longer time. given the circumstance, hong kong goverment established a policy which force people to scan the qr code with the leave home safe app for against the covid-19, it was not very common initially without any punishment, yet after announcing the 10-year prison sentences amd 60-throusand-dollar fines, hongkongers use the app quite often now. so that probably means that the more punlishment they will get, the more attentive and cautious they will have.
on the other hand, it seem likely to have another proper ways to reduce the crimes . one example is creat a better and well-rounded education for people, particularly for youngsters. some people could think of it is a more efficient way to develop and nurture thier manner for their whole life. for example, there are a lot of different kind of extra curriculums which consist of having a talk with polices and icac for students to join and teach them some form of concept to be a good citizen and take their responsibilities living in hong kong. perhaps, it can show them some societal expectation rather than arresting them and destroy their future.
to summarize, there are different opinions for this statement. even so, i believe that if we had spoon-feed information and set a better model for people, it will help people to reflect on their bad behaviour. likewise, if goverment only established a lot of punishment for his residents consisently, they may feel stress out. it is probably not good for a long term development for a morden as well as international city and country.",6.5
many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. why is this happening? what can be done to help people overcome this problem?,"many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. this is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.one of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. this has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. a knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. this type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life’s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. this will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.in conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. however, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.",8.0

on the one hand, people are more willing to suceess in the race of their games and sometimes failed. for the reasons of that they never thought that which would be the answer is that physically strength would give them to succeed in their pace of games and other sports they choice. for example, the more they do exercises before entering the match, the body will strong enough till the end of the contest. then the succeed will come next of grasp.
on the other hand, the mental strength would be the main strength and sources of succeed which is the beginning point of the contest. not even enough the exercises of mind, people would not get the immense advances of win. it means that people's minds might to be whatever they lose in the math, they can get it and stand up right their pace. as long as they get this point of action into their mind, i believed that they are eagle to strong enough to be ready to their games and other atheletics. moreover, when they practice before entering the space of match, the embedded mind would be the main sources of mental strength too. it gives them to the progress of steps and the successful way until the end of the sports.

should the same laws which prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? discuss.,"recently, a heated debate when a few reputable health organizations suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition . in this , i will analyze why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our youngsters’ safety, according to my vision.firstly, tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the addictive effect. , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on smoker’s brain cells. numerous experiments carried out by on animals, rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead time to dependency, similarly to the effect experienced with .secondly, the restriction on selling would surely show an instant decline in tobacco smoking. ” having easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, especially on teenagers,to resist such a temptation” dr.hisham , head of department at alexandria medical college , states firmly. “giving the new generation the sense that the severity of smoking is to other lethal drugs usage be a life saving step, they will thank us for as they get older.” he continues.to recapitulate, applying of a futuristic law such as the suggested one will have a positive impact ,not only on young people’s health but on our society as a whole.",7.0
"some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. to what extent do you agree or disagree?","in developed country, economic wealth is not an issue for them. some people argue that more growth in economics won't provide additional satisfaction to its citizens. i partially agree with this viewpoint that any additional economical growth will have a diminishing returns in developed country. however money is still the driving force to well-beings.
the statisfaction level of the citizens in developed country is driven by many factors. economical stability is of course a very important one to consider. however, there are other factors such as health care systems, education systems, and enviormental protections. these are also equally important to the financial stability of one country. degree of satisfaction for citizens should be measured in many aspects.
on the other hand, economic wealth is the main fundemental to reach beyond just putting food on the tables. for government, any additional wealth can be utlized to slove potential social problems. for examble, there is always money needed to funding hospitals for better health care. secondly, additioanl wealth can also be used for protection of the country against terriosts attack and war prevention. the military force needs ongoing funding to promote stability and order in the world for developed country. thirdly, more wealth can be used to develop new technology to better our daily lives. if we need a new breakthrough in high tech industry, government needs more financial support to help scientists doing reseach and development.
in conclusion, i believe the satisfaction of citizens in developed country can always be better off with additional wealth.",5.5

"in some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. discuss this view and give your opinion.give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.you should write at least 250 words.","in many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. there is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. this is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.one of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. after puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. however, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. these teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. there is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.a major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. this can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.in conclusion, i feel that children should be educated all together, although i would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. my personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.",9.0

some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. what solution is better?,"some big cities, especially in tokyo, osaka, and yokohama in japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. this is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around japan.
initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. there are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. there seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.
in contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. it seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. but, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. in addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. these issues are long controversial as a first world problem.
finally, as covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. innumerable companies adopted it systems that are able to work remotely. in addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, covid-19 completely ended. this means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. this effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.
in conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. as a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.",5.5

overall, we can divide the steps into two stages where the first one is you have to produce the wool and the second one is to make the string.
in order to get the wool pr the string, we have to do the shearing process and clean them after we take them from the sheep. after that, we let them dry in a sufficient temperature outside so that we can spin them.
after we finish the spinning process, we break them into two productions which are wool and string. the string production can be recycled while the wool can be made into tufts of wool and put them in the tuft of storage.
the balls of yarn comes from the tuft storage which later are the things that we are knitting. the balls of yarn are also the main source to make woolen goods such carpets and jackets which are usually we use in a daily life.",5.5

first of all, people tend to the more information the internet has, the more benefit the users get. this means that people will become more proficient in their majors and works due to gaining a lot of relevant resources online in different areas. a case in point is different professional like managers, doctors, teachers and lawers can require a wider range of references to complete and reach their working goals as well as improve the workplace situation. hence, it is highly likely to see that it may good to share as much information as possible online.
conversely, some critis argue that if every information shared freely, it would harmful to academic development such as intellectual property. this is to say that when people missused these kinds of information, there would occur plagiarism much more easily. a good illustration to my point is some university students would copy different resources to their eassies in order to get a higher sorce or avoid some complicated experiments. even some companies will copy another products design from their opponents. therefore, it is possibly to say that in bid to protect their intellectual property, some information must not have shared by free.
to summarise, it is hard to say that which sides of opinion is the best. but even so, in my point of veiw, the key is moderation. what means by this is when people want to share their opinions as well as reseachs online, they should make an informed decision for sharing it freely or not. unless they take this measures, the conflicts will never stop.",5.5

to begin with, that art subject is important for children's growth. research shows that art is a creative way or language to depict the feelings of children while it also indicates that they are a better solution to release the stress by drawing. some studies also suggested that they are a remedy to those who are suffering from anxiety or depression as it helps to release the oxytocin in the body to feel good. furthermore, it helps to improve the mental growth of children.

2 weeks ago, i saw an environmental documentary from the television and i heard the cause of air pollution. there were many factors that could effect the air pollution, but one of the factors was the usage of the car. when we ride a car, the car produces harmful chemical gases such as carbon dioxide that lead to foggy weather. if we inhale this gases often, our lungs will become unhealthy and in worst case, lead to death. therefore, over-reliance on cars will increase the number of people with lung disease as they produce bad chemicals.
to prevent production of harmful chemicals from the car, many people have to use bus or train for transportation rather than their private car, so government have to do campaign to use them and make festival to persuade people to use public transport. this will help the environment to reduce greenhouse gases and people to inhale more fresh air than before.
in conclusion, many people prefer to ride the private car as it is more comfortable, however, the consequences of usage of car are harmful to the environment and people's health, therefore government should educate or persuade people to use public transports instead of riding a car.",6.5

some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. discuss both views and give your opinion.,"some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. on the other hand, others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. this essay will discuss both views and my opinion.
some people insist that punishment is a priority as culprits have gone agaisnt ones country's law. when they serve more years in prison, there is no chance for them to re-commit crime. in addition, some suppose that those who can not afford themselves, will feel better in the prison. as prisoners have to live in a systmatized cycle, they do not need to plan their budget and life. there is interview with an offender who continuously commits crime to go back to the prison.
contemporarily, others say that there are better ways to reduce crime, such as rehabiliation and education. most offenders lack moral value. furthermore, they mostly have wrong mindsets or thoughts as some have never been educated properly. therefore, other people think that education is better way to improve prisoners' behaviour. society ought to give an opportunity to re-start their life again.
i agree more with the second view. obviously, we have to punish those people whoever break the law. however, punishment should not be a priority. education is important. community need to lead a way for them so that they can re-born as a totally different person. there is a statistics of crimes rates in the united states of america which implicits that strict punishment and longer prison sentences reversely led to an increase in crime rates. therefore, the government needs to concentrate more on education and rehabiliation rather than security and control.",6.5
reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. this kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"nowadays, it is often said that mass media interest in reporting crimes and violence happening in our society may lead to negative effects. therefore, there is a public debate over the opportunity of excluding this kind of news from mass media, such as newspapers or television. in this essay, i will summarize the grounds for my stance, which is completely in favour of this viewpoint.
the mair reason why i believe that crimes and violence news should be restricted is the emulation risk. in this view, television is often watched by kids left alone, who may not be able to fully undestand what they see. therefore, if they continue to hear about violence and crimes, they may begin to consider them as a normal part of our society and start adopting these behaviours. for instance, a teenager may think that it is normal to fight with someone else in case of an argue outside pubs or clubs.
another reason in favour of crimes and violence news restriction is the exaltation of criminals. this may be epitomised by serial killers: on one side they are sentenced for terrible crimes, but on the other hand are sometimes proposed to accept a huge amount of money in order to make interviews or write books about their stories. if media did not talk about these crimimals, none of them would earn money as a consequence of its guilts.
in conclusion, i believe that there are many valid reasons for claiming a reduction of violence and crimes news on social media. emulation of wrong behaviours by young people and enrichment of criminals are two of the most common arguments. all thing considered, i strongly advocate the need of restricting mass media's time spent to talk about crimes and violence. this aim may be pursued by public authorities, through the promulgation of new laws and rules.",7.0

nevertheless, as each breakthrough that the society does, there are repercussions. in this case, the harmful effect of this discovery is global warming because when humans go somewhere, they let a carbon footprint which directly changes the environment. for instance, if individuals had to travel to south pole, they would only use air or marine transport such as cruise ship which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. as a result, those greenhouse gases can warm nature which, unfortunately, would melt the ice and have a detrimental impact on the landscapes. as a consequence, in the forthcoming decades, this panorama may disappear. thereby, if scientists want to study this natural area, they could not or in a limited way.

"schools should select students by their academic abilities, agree or disagree?","some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. discuss both views and state your own opinion.some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. however, from my perspective, i disagree with this contention.admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. in such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. from example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. in this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.despite the argument above, i believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. as for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. this practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. to be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. in this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.on top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way. according to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. in the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. in sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.in the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.the writer presented a balanced discussion of the topic, effortlessly delivered in a form of a fluent, well-written ielts essay. the arguments and reasoning are laid out in a coherent, logical way. a wide range of vocabulary is used in this work. there are very few spelling errors that could have been caught in an additional round of proofreading (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). keep up the good work! overall, this essay seems worthy of ielts band 8.",8.0

while using fists to communicate is definitely inappropriate people claim, that this is not what happens in a boxing match. everybody who steps into the ring consents to the physical altercation and is aware of the risks associated with it. furthermore, there are precautions taken and a jury in session to make sure nobody gets seriously hurt. those points cause many fans of the sport to claim, that it is not so differnt to most other sports since there is always a possibility to get hurt. additionally, one might argue that what two consenting adults do in there past time or as their job is just nobody elses business.
on the other hand, people who don't think boxing should continue, often are convinced that society sets the wrong incentives. the promise of fame and quick money that is often associated with a career in boxing might tempt some to disregard their long-term health for short-term gain. since socially disadvantaged individuals are less likely to have alternative prospects, one might argue that it is not a real choice after all. another concern of critics is the corruption of the audience. frequent exposure to violent entertainment is often connected to a higher likelyhood to become violent.

write about the following topic.some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. discuss both views and give your opinion.give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. in order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. in my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.
on the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. the supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. it is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.
on the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. the more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. as customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.
in conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both.",8.5

"the diagram below shows the average hours of unpaid work per week done by people in different categories. (unpaid work refers to such activities as childcare in the home, housework and gardening.)describe the information presented below, comparing results for men and women in the categories shown. suggest reasons for what you see.","the given bar chart presents how many unpaid-work hours are weekly spend by married females and males. these kinds of work include childcare at home, housework, gardening and other forms of such activities.
it is clear from the chart, that married males spend constantly just below 20 weekly hours on average on unpaid work, regardless of the number of children they have. on the other hand, married women spend more hours than their spouses, and this period seems to increase proportionately with the number of children in the family.
as is shown by the chart, married women without children attribute 30 hours on average every week for unpaid work. compared to childless married women, women with one or two children spend around 50 weekly hours on average in those activities. turning to women with more than two kids, they have the most time spent on unpaid house work, with 60 hours per week.
overall, this gender related trend can be related to the traditional premise that women ought to pursue most of the work at home while men are supposed to work outside earning money for their mutual survivorship.",8.0

in some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,"the gap year is an issue that has sparked debate. it is widely accepted that young people should travel or work for a year between completing high school and beginning university studies. from a personal perspective, the benefits are more significant than the drawbacks for young people who decide to have a gap year.
on the one hand, most students who just completed high school education have stressful periods and lots of plans that want to do. young people could feel disoriented which means they need time for finding what they want. there are a lot of youths who put themselves under pressure thus, they get more and more stress in their study and work and can get some mental illness. in order to have a gap year, they will have enough time to relax and establish a plan for their future. nowadays, more and more students decide to choose a year to do anything that they hope to perform. besides, their decision will help them understand themselves, and have opportunities to experience jobs that have not been done before such as volunteer work and long-day traveling.
on the second hand, there are some negative points of a gap year for the youths. the young people who decide to have a free year will face late completing university studies which may lead to having fewer opportunities than their peers deciding to start university immediately. on some occasions, it is difficult for young people who do not have any experience to find internship jobs. thus, they may waste lots of time without any achievement.

a country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.to what extent do you agree or disagree?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"there are people who believe that the mixture of nationalities make faster the development of a country. although, it could seem that an international environment could influence negatively the culture of a country, i believe that the exchange that is born from people coming from different places is essential in order to develop the social attitudes of the citiziens and to have new ideas and perspectives.
the internationality of a country permits people to develop their social attitudes. to live in the same country with people who have originated in a different one require all of them to be open to discover now personal outlooks. they have to communicate between each other and also to respect the different cultural habits they have. this lead people to be more open-minded and ready to accept new changes. a country in which there are these features will develop from different point of view faster. indeed, people will be already able to understand the flow of the new trends and they will be open to new economical and political choices. by contrast, in a country in which there is no way to interact with people who have a different nationality will be more difficult to understand the limit and the possibilities of their country. although the tradition of the country will be preserved, people will be less accostumated to the change trying to mantain their traditional custums, even if uncorrect, as soon as they can. the political and economical assestment of these country will reflect the closeness of the population. for instance, they will be less concerned about the stability of the other countries and they will try to develop their own without caring of the international consequences.
furthermore, a country in which there are different people who comes from different places is one in which new ideas and perspectives can be develped. indeed, workplaces will be encouraged in their development by the interaction between people who have different culture. in the general picture, the benefit of each single and small company will impact positively on the country itself and its economical status. to go further, people who have to interact with other foreign nationalities will be able to communicate with them and this means that they will be able to speak and understand other languages other than their mother tongue. the ability to be fluently in other languages, mostly in english, nowadays is essential for the develop of a country. the companies will be able to expand their trade.

to begin with, one of the main reason for this sport to exist is for the entertainment it gives an individual. in other words, boxing is one of the sport where it is not only fun since in the moment it not only gives the player an adrenalie rush but also it occurs breathtaking moments for audience.for example,in recent time magazine, thery were talking about a boxing match that has occured and discussed the whole match which naturally stirs up conversations as well helps the sport get more publicity. moreover, there is someing oddly satisfying in boxing matches that helps people to be in the moment.
secondly,like every other sport boxing is an amazing sport to get ones frastration out in a helthy way even though the results can sometime leave the boxers with injuries and lifelong damages. to exaplain further, in every physical sport from football ,tenis and all the other sport there is always chance of getting injured one way or other, it's called sport injuries.to illustrate, in recent studies done by oxford, it says that in all type of sports as well as doing normal gym there is always risk of getting fractures or other serious injuries.besides,phycologists recomend this sport to thoes who has serious anger issues to help them get that emotion out in a hwalthy way and to prevent them from other risky behaviour.

"the diagram shows a process of making a storage area from a material called concrete canvassummarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.","the given diagram illustrates the process of the storage area, which is made from a special material, namely concrete canvas. the process can be outlined in eight consecutive steps, beginning with the manufacturing of the concrete canvas and culminating with storing of goods.
firstly, the concrete canvas is produced as a three-layers composite. it consists of a fibrous top surface, a layer of dry concrete, and a waterproof layer. the features of each layer play different roles in later usage in terms of ductility and stability. the finished product of the concrete canvas is then packaged in boxes and delivered by truck to the construction site, where the boxes are unwrapped, and the canvas inside is taken out.
in the next stage, the concrete canvas is spread by means of a rope drawn by a vehicle. in order to fix the canvas on the ground, pegs are used and hammered every ten meters along each side of the canvas. after that, on one end of the spread canvas, a door is installed as the entrance of the storage. the covered space between the canvas and the underground is then pumped up and expanded with the aid of a blower machine. following that, water is sprinkled over the surface of the swollen canvas and reacted with dry concrete with the aim of generating a hard shell for storage. thus, the form of storage is constructed. after a set period of around 20 to 24 hours, the storage can be put into use.",8.5
"write about the following topic.it is now possible for scientists and tourists to travel to remote natural environment, such as the south pole.what are advantages and disadvantages of this development?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","nowadays, due to the development in science and technology, expolring the remote natural places has become available. exploring is what scientists and tourists are always like and eager to do because, invariably, unknown keeps an attraction of mystery. however, there are pros and cons in travelling to remote natural environment.
as far as we know, the improvement in science and progress in technology always comes from exploring the unknown destinations. travelling to a remote natural environment, take the south pole for example, can conduct many research which cannot be done in common places. these kinds of research is helpful in biology and in finding the origin of human being. the second biggest advantage is that it can improve the tourism in its local area, and tourism means a better condition for local people. in the past, in some remote places of china without torism, the native people there had a poor sanitory condition and after the arrivals of travellers, people there can earn a living and improve their living conditions.
however, everything in the world has its donwside. the activities in scientific research and commerce will cause contalmination to the environment in remote places. for instance, the constructions of the scientific stations have occupied the places where many wild animals there used to call home. there is no doubt that such activities will lead to a decrease in the number of these animals which will also influent the local ecosystem.
to sum up, the travel to remote natural environment will not only help to improve the development of science but also help with the local tourism, but the disadvantage is that these activities will cause damages to the local environment.",7.5
in some countries people spend long hours at work. why does this happen? is it positive or negative development,"striving for own career development is most of the people's lifetime target in the modern city. in some nations, employees spend long time at work becomes a phenomenon. this essay is going yo discuss the reasons behind and i reckon that this is a negative development for both the companies and employees.
there are two main reasons behind this phenomenon. firstly, it could be the corporate culture of the company. the management members of the company may agree that workers spending a long period of time in the office equals to excellent performance. for instance, employees in japanese company could get a greater annual bonus or better chance to promote if they are eager to work for a long hours. this forces the employees to to show up in the office just because of giving a good impression to the boss.
secondly, as the competition between different companies in the market is nervous, coporate sectors are willing to push their colleagues to enhance their sales or performance. it causes a great pressure to the employees whom need to work for long hours to fuifill the expectation from the managements. for example, product sales agents' performance depends on the sales number quarterly. if the agent cannot sale the products effectively, they will receive less revenues or even being sacked.
as per the reasons stated, i absolutely think that it is a negative development for both the employees and companies. it is because it gives the unnecessary pressure to the colleagues which will affect their mental health. inversely, it downgrades the performance of the employee as well as the company. work-life balance is important to everyone as suitable relaxing time can considerably enhance the performance of human.",7.5
some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. discuss both views.,"certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. while hosting sport events might also entail risks, i firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as i will explain below.
international sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. this usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. people need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. on the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. it is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. let us take the example of the city montreal in canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. for example, it is not a secret that some countries such as germany and russia have used the world cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.
it is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. these competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.
in conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. these events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.",7.0

on the one hand, there is a necessity to invade some admission fees, because a public institution can't survive without financial support. there is a majority of different museums and art galleries that use their entrance earnings to improve the quality of cultural and educational service that they provide. for instance, this money is used to restore some ancient historical or art exhibits, pay salaries for the staff and buy new interesting artifacts to attract new visitors. furthermore, having extra income from attenders allows to conduct different expensive exhibitions and attract sponsors.
on the other hand, some museums and art galleries are under governmental support, so there is no need to implement additional payments because they already have the necessary equipment and staff. however, here the question of the quality of provided service arises. in other words, we do not know whether it is worth going or not. despite this fact, people are more likely to visit free of charge places rather than charged ones.

having homework most of the days helps children to develop their discipline. they might be interested in other activities like seeing friends or playing video games. however, children must learn to prioritize their homework over other activities, which promotes discipline. similarly, if they want to do things different than their homework, children need to plan and adjust their time, thus learning valuable skills such as time-management. both skills, discipline and time-management, will help children to perform better later in life. additionally, it is reasonable to think that children who do their homework will be exposed to study topics for a longer period of time, thus deepening their learning experience. therefore, they will be more knowledgeable in the future. finally, one can expect that children who do their homework will be used to working for longer periods of time, which will be helpful during their transition to university and the working life.
on the other hand, homework-free schools also have advantages. these children will have more time at home to explore their own interests and hobbies. they could learn skills not typically taught at school like photography or singing. since most children dislike homework, one could also hypothetize that children attending a homework-free school would be happier. finally, one can expect that these children would be less stresssed.

on one hand, the space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over recent years. scientists researching to find out and trying to know what is hiding out of the black hole and another universal plant if it is livable or has any natural resources. for example, in 1991 research proved that to travel from the earth to the nearest planet it could take approximately 3 to 4 months continually. in other words, exploration of a planet is costly as well as takes much time to reach it.
on the other hand, the benefit of universe exploration may change our earth's environment and improve our lives for the next coming generation in technology. for instance, people after the year 2000 had better communication with each other which was not even possible at any time ever. moreover, the government invests to develop space exploration companies.
in conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view i strongly believe that space companies such as spacex must try to find a new resources to visit other planets. however, i agree that they should be done after providing the basic needs of the human on earth and investing to solve poverty and any other human tragedies.",6.5
the diagram below shows the development of cutting tools in the stone age. summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.you should write at least 150 words.,"the provided diagram clearly sheds light on the main differences in the developments occurred on the sharp tools, used for cutting objects, in two distinct eras; 1.4 and 0.8 millions years ago.
overall, all dimensions obviously show an identical view of both tools ( a and b ). however if details were focused on, many distinctions could be seen.
1.4 million years ago, the three displayed examples of sharp gadgets used for cutting show a dimensional scene of how the tool was innovated. the narrow view of the side angle explain the fact that such tool was an efficient one. with a length of almost 10cm, it was quiet frankly enough to tear any rigid object it encounters. one unconsidered point, is how the front and the back sides were not as thin and skinny as effective as the side angle. but not as essential. the side angle must be designed potentially thin, in case any hard object required a greater sharpness and strength.
in the following 6 million years, the design showed a dramatic change. the whole views had encountered a modification at some point. the front in addition to the rear hand side views; had displayed no changes if related to the side one. side view showed a significant efficient change, with a smaller, thinner and much sharper angle, such tool became extraordinarly advantageous. however, the size length measured 10 cm which is respectfully identical to the previous mentioned tool design.",7.0
"the diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.","the diagrams show the way in which the flooding of houses may be prevented by constructing them upon raised foundations, so that the floor of the house is separated from the highest probable water level (considering a period of 100 years) by at least 300 millimeters (30 centimeters). this distance is called ""freeboard.""
the first diagram shows how this may be accomplished in situations in which the house is located between a stopbank -that is, a barrier separating the river or drain from the area in which the house is located- and a hill or otherwise elevated area from which rainwater may run downhill (a phenomenon known as ""internal runoff""), potentially creating a pond in the area in which the house stands. in such a situation, the diagram shows that the stopbank should be higher than the 100-year flood level, although it does not show the minimum clearance required. at the same time, the house should be high enough that its floor is at least 300 millimeters above the 100-year ponding level.
the second diagram shows the way in which the house should be protected from floods in situations where there is no stopbank. in such cases, the house should simply be raised to a height at least 300 millimeters above the 100-year flood level. the second diagram does not show the effects of any internal runoff.
both diagrams provide for a common solution, which is to have a minimum freeboard of 300 millimeters between the bottom of the house and the highest probable water level, be it the 100-year flood level or the 100-year ponding level.",8.5

"the movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.what are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedgive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","in recent years, more people tend to move to big cities from the countryside has been increasing extremely, especially developed countries, including japan. therefore, the total population in the country seems to be not changed, but the balance of the population has been widening in a few decades. i would like to share some example in japan and suggest ideas to reverse its population in the countryside.
mainly, job opportunities in the big cities are much higher than in the countryside. the majority of companies and foreign company branches tend to be located in tokyo, and osaka. therefore, people need to move to the big cities or suburbs area to get their jobs. this means that real estate, house, and apartment prices have been soaring drastically. moreover, the phenomenon connects to the prices rise up in a variety of industries. for example, the food prices in the restaurants need to raise due to monthly tenants payment has been surging. therefore, people can easily get or change their job in big cities, it is not necessarily wealthy.
nevertheless, ironically, since covid-19 widely spread worldwide, many companies launched remote work. even now, the majority of people do not need to commute to the office. in addition, some companies declare that they never change the working system in the future, because they have already systemized the it system which is able to work remotely. therefore, this is a great chance for the japanese government to dissipate the population in local cities. if people start to move to local cities or countryside, the population in the local cities or countryside increased. it will be not only helpful for people to live there with reasonable prices, but also for effective economic growth in the local cities and countryside. in addition, the local governments will be able to organize the infrastructure, roads, medical care, and education. as a result, the quality of the infrastructure will be close to the big cities.
finally, if the government financially supported this remote working system to companies, the above phenomenon will be available. as a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider, and people will be able to get job opportunities with living in the countryside.",5.5
competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. how does competitiveness affect individuals? is it a positive or negative trend?,"life is full of competition. soon after the release from competitive university exams, the hard fighting for higher positions in a company will be waiting for you. while the competitiveness has been bringing us a convenient society, no small number of employments have been tired of never-ending competitions. no doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. this essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of japanese modern society and typical japanese office workers. i believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.
firstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. if there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. the evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the hr evaluation. for example, japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. however, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? most japanese companies adopted the hr evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. that’s why the japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. in addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. this tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.
secondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. as a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.
consequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns. karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in japan. we may need to rethink about the competitiveness.",7.5
"some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.to what extent do you agree or disagree?","it's argued that some people belive that now a dayes the papulation age is much longer then before there for the retiring age must be raised.
from my point of view i srongly disagree with this statment, i belive that everything has it owns lemit phiecly and mently, wether you were an adult or from the yungster side, there for we should not change the retiring age for a lot of reasons.
first of all the older a person get the faster they get tired easly, for example if a person is working in the hospitality endestry like in a restrunt and serving people it will be very hard for an old man or women to switch from a table to anathor, or hold hevy things, also that way they are more exposed to bad engries
second of all when a person get older his brain is more likly going to get weaker there for it will be harder for them to functaion also there memory will get weaker too in that stuation that will make work extra harder for them there for it would not make the working enviroment fear for people at all, for example ueasly for evrey one who work in the same job will get paid the same amount but that would not be fear for older people becuase they put more efert to there work.
inconclusion i feel that having an age restriction for jobs is hugly important in different ways like working qulity and people's health.",5.0
"nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. what are the reasons for this problem? what are the effects on society?","recently, more and more students choose to study finance, management or other subjects instead of science in university around the world. there are many reasons contribute to this phenomenon and this would definetely impose negative influences on our society.
in terms of the factors, the reason is mainly due to the job market. firstly, we have to admit that the number of science job vacancies in the market is significantly lower than the other occupations, like the nurse, the accountant, the lawyer and so on. besides this, the science is comparatively difficult than the other subjects. if you want to be a qualified scientist, you are more likely to spend more time on learning and researching, maybe three years more than the other subjects. so, very naturally, few people would like to take the risk of learning science.
however, science does play an extremely important role in our society. if not enough people study science, it may impede the development of the country. science represents the future of our nation because it could help to improve the development of technology and then make new technologies into pratical products. a good example can be seen in the united states, which has experienced a huge development in science during the past decades and has created a lot of advanced products, such as the microsoft and artificial intelligence, which has bring great benefits to this country in return and make it become the most powerful nation in the world. in contrast, if very few people learning science, the nation may remain at a standstill and lose its competitiveness.
in conclusion, although few people want to study science, the government should take efficient measures to encourage the public to study this subject to help our society improving continuously in the long future.",5.5
the advantages of the spread of english as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"there is no doubt that these days more people is learning and talking by english language. the question is, is this viral of english has a negative view or not? in this essay i will discuss and draw my personal conclusion.
in terms of advantages there is many. firstly, this spread of english language wil make the communication easier more than before . in other words, travelling to a new country that you are not speak there language is not a big problem these days because most of people are speaking english or at least know the main essential questions and there answers .to illustrate, if you are travelling to italy you don't have to learn italian language your english will be enough. secondly, some languages are hard to learn like chinese and turkish, so using the english as a united language is much easier than using other language.
moreover the massive spread to english may had some disadvantages the main given reason i support this claim is that the consist of using english language in countries will make some other languages disappear. to illustrate, some countries now are choosing not to speak with their naive language and replace it with english in work and school and all daily conversations. on other hand, some countries like turkey most of their citizens will ignore you when you don't ask them with turkish.
in conclusion, although this spread of english may diminish other languages, but still having english language is important. that's why i believe that using english is essential especially if you are working with international companies and collegues.",6.0
"some people think students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. others think that school time should be used in learning important subjects. discuss both views and give your opinion?give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","with diet and nutrition becoming more and more popular nowadays, the food industry started to attract a significant number of people to join in, students included. while young people today are encouraged by many to pursue knowledge in related fields, some argue that school time should be invested in other important subjects. personally, i strongly disagree with the latter.
the insignificance of food study is a misconception because of two major reasons. first of all, food is one of our most fundamental needs, but that doesn't make it less important than other fields. in fact, contrary to the common belief, it is actually a subject that still requires much research. for example, we are yet aware of the exact effects of different nutrtients and chemicals on our physiological process. another problem is the belief that food is not as promising as other science subjects such as biology and physics. however, the statistics said otherwise. in the past decades, profits generated from food industry have been climbing steadily and already overtaken some of the traditional forms.
pursuing a degree in food science is never a waste of time but its value has become more prominent in recent years. not only can it help individuals learn more about the mechanism behind food, but it also enables them to lead a heathier life. in addition, as public awareness in health increases, people are paying more attention to what they put in their mouth, so much so that they are willing to pay for a professional to formulate their meal plan, which is a career with great potential for students interested in food research.
in conclusion, students should be encouraged to study the science and procedures of preparing food because it is a topic just as important as any other subjects.",7.0

moving the attention away from hamburgers, we can see that the increase in salad consumption is more drastic than that of other fast food categories. specifically, the predicted increase in fried chicken consumption is 10 units, which is outshadowed by the 36-unit increase for salad. this suggests that, while more fast food will be consumed overall, the general public is shifting towards healthier options.
finally, although the consumption for hamburger, friedn chicken, and salad all increased significantly, figures for fried rice and noodles remained stagnant. this suggests that both fried rice and noodles are less welcomed by the consumers compared to other fast food.",6.0

"write about the following topic.music is played in every society and culture in the world today.some people think that music brings only benefits to individuals and societies. others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both.discuss both these views and give your own opinion.give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","there are only a few things that many societies and cultures have in common, and one of these is music. despite its universality, however, there is a controversy pertaining to its actual effects on not only people but on societies as well. while its benefial effects is acknowledged, some people still believe that it has a negative influence on people and societies. in my opinion, the benefits of music to both individuals and societies outweighs its detremental effects. in this essay, however, i will discuss both points of views.
to start with, the fact that some people consider music a bad influcence is understandable especially when considering idolisation of musicians among young people. for example, the effect that the current world wide sensation korean boy band, bts, have on a lot of young people is unexplanable. many youngsters have idolised this group to the extent where it affects their education and life in general. definately, parents of children affected by this group will not be happy with their activities and will therefore develop negative feelings towards them. furthermore, as many more young people lose focus because of their love for music and musicians, the society suffers in the long run because these people are less likely to be productive members of the society.
moving on, music also has a number of positive effects on people and societies. the first being that it is actually a lucrative source of livelihood for those involved and it also creats job opportunities. to explain further, musicians do not work alone, they need to be managed, they need a stylist, a make-up artist, song writers, graphic designers, to name a few and all these positions create an opportunity for young people to fill them. furthermore, music is a good way to relax and calm one's mind. this method is even employed in therapy to aide the treatment or management of some anxiety disorders. lastly, considering its effect on societies, the contribution of the music industry to a nations economy cannot be overlooked. its contribution has always been tremendous and many times, important political figures have awarded musicians that have played a huge role in not only the economy of the country but her public image as well. for instance, very recently, the president of south korea awarded bts for their contribution, through their music, to the growth and international recognition of the country.
in conclusion, despite the controversy, in my opinion, the effect of music has more pros than cons on both individuals and societies because the industry not only creates job opportunities, music can also be used for the management of some mental health disorders and finally, it contributes a lot to a country's economy.",6.0

write about the following topic.an increasing number of people are choosing to have cosmetic surgery in order to improve their appearance. why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? do you think this a positive or negative development?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"there is currently a contentious argument regarding the purpose of having cosmetic surgery since more and more people prefer to use this method to improve their appearance. considering the factors that support the decision to choose this improvement method, there are various reasons which i will discuss in this essay. in terms of consequences, i personally believe that there is a positive development.
it is the fact that people have a wide variety of rationales to have cosmetic surgery. an obvious example of this is that people can design their new appearance in the way they wish to be look like. this is because a doctor could perform modern medical techniques such as modifying bone at the patients’ nose to change their real face, which natural face improvement cannot do. another common reason is the increase in self-confidence. when people have plastic surgery, they tend to believe that their appearance will be more accepted by other people, helping them to feel more confident.
contemplating the effects of people who have plastic surgery, there are many vital advantages. a common criticism in favour of this is the rise in productivity in workplace. when people feel more confident as a result of having cosmetic surgery, they tend to be more courageous to communicate with people in other departments, leading to the increasing workflow between two teams. another classic example is building more networking. this is because people who positively improve their appearance tend to attract other people’s attention. as a result, more and more people might want to know them.
in conclusion, it is undeniable that cosmetic surgery could address people’s eagerness to have better appearance and be more confident, which, in my opinion, results in a positive consequence to both society and them. this is because they would have willingness to contact other people and draw other people’s attention to them, which could grow their connections.",8.0
many people support animal testing while others believe it isn’t appropriate (discuss),"many people support use of animals for testing medicines for humans. others believe it isn’t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. discuss both views and give your own opinion.sample essayapproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. while some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. personally, i am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. there isn’t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. what’s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. this is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.to sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. in my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug.",8.0

write about the following topic.in some parts of the world people try to find out one's own family history. why do people do this? do you think it is a positive or negative?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"at present, discovering one`s own family history is becoming more and more commom. in the following paragraphs, i will present the motives why people do that and the reason i strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.
probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. one of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.
moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. when people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.
as mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. one and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.
to summarize, one may try to find out about their family history for two main motives, one being about their health and the other one about feeling part of a community. both reasons are important and have positive impacts on one`s life.",5.5
people living in large cities have to face many problems in everyday life. what are those problems?should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"it is no doubt that cities are amongst the most convienient places for accommodation but with it, comes many sophisticated issuses, threatening the residents quality of life.in my opinion,in order to solve this problem,it is essential for governments balance the country's population distribution by encouring people to move to rural areas.
what are the difficulties while living in large cities then?firstly, it is the lack of jobs and occupations due to the fierce competitiveness between thousands of applicants.moreover,because of high number of employees,regularly will companies raise their standards making it painfully challenging to get a job .for instance,to be hired as an accountant,not only do you need flawless techinque skills but also flexibility and adaptiveness to satisfy the company's demand and surpass other applicants.secondly,the increasing population density can be a potential security endangerment as the rate of criminals and lawbreakers is significantly higher than places with fewer residents.furthermore,tracking down criminals will more challenging because of the widespread radius of populated areas.for example,chasing down a theif in a countryside would be far more easier than a city because there are less space to hide and shelter for the theifs.
hence, the government should encourage people to move to outlying areas.at first glance,it fixes the issue of jobs and occupation as civilians are now fairly distributed to other regions, creating a less stressing and competitive working environment.as a matter of fact,the rate of poverty and famine will be reduced as the income for most famlies become higher thanks to more
job opportunities.in addition,by having scatterd citizen equally,we can ensure the safety of our people by managing the crime rate of each region.in fact,this will prevent crime concentration in one area but scatter them in many places,making it more convenient to protect civilians.
in conclusion,living in large cities can have multiple drawbacks,especially job opportunity and security therefore motivating citizen relocate to urban areas should be considered as soon as possible for the reasons above.",7.0
the advantages of the spread of english as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"since the middle of the 19th century, english is recognized as the most important language and world common language. there is a variety of advantages because the number of english speakers, including non-native speakers has been increasing across the globe. i strongly agree with this phenomenon.
to go into detail, european countries, such as switzerland, and belgium are configured with some languages in one country, such as german, french, and italian. therefore, english is categorized as a common language in these countries. in addition, the us and european countries have been leading in a variety of fields, such as science, technology, and academic topics. therefore, some countries, including germany, the netherlands, and north european countries followed learning english to keep up with technology. therefore, the number of non-native speakers has widely and drastically increased in europe to communicate smoothly. as a result, since internet technology has widely spread around the world, japanese people can search for any kind of information in english more than five times higher than searching for the same information in japanese. therefore, learning english is inevitable for japanese people, as well as other asian countries or developing countries.
fortunately, thanks to recent technology, it is getting easier to study english. for example, online english lessons, such as cambly allows us to learn english 24/7. in addition, in some social media, the name of an app ""club house"" is a convenient app to have a conversation with the same users worldwide. therefore, we can easily share cultural differences and tips to improve our english skill.
in contrast, some people are concerned about their own native language might be vanished in the future. in iceland, although there is a native language, ""icelandish"" language still remains and is spoken in iceland, but some people are anxious the language's complex grammar and vocabulary are difficult to explain in some detail. according to the researcher, they are astonished young students are all hanging out only in english, instead of icelandish. therefore, the government has been making an effort to maintain the native language by taking advantage of national media such as, podcast, radio, tv broadcast are only spoken in icelandish language.
finally, thanks to english language, more people are willing to communicate with a lot of people who speak english. this phenomenon is not only convenient to understand cultural differences, but also helpful to learn a variety of subject in english for developing countries, like in the philipinnes. tagalogue language is limited to cover some vocabulary to learn academic subjects.
in conclusion, english will continuously spread worldwide.",7.0
there is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher.what might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? how should we deal with this problem?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"it is true that artificial activities cause temperature rising. while this is a serious problem, it can be solved by keeping the proper line when we use artificial objects. in this essay, i will write the causes of temperatures rising and solution of these problems.
the main causes of temperature rising is human-made things. first, many people use air-conditional in summer and this can make glaciers melting. there is a study that too much uses of air-conditional are melting the glaciers. when the glaciers melt, the earth temperatures raise 4'c. in addition, nowadays, many people use cars when they go out. this can be a cause of rising temperature. this is because when we use cars, it spread the exhaust gas which influence to the air and temperatures.
however, there are solutions to this problem, one of the ways to solve temperature rising because of man-made is to use proper artificial things. when we use air-conditional in daily life. it is important to remain proper temperature, to 24-26'c. also, we can wear light clothes instead of using gadgets. furthermore, when we go to the place which has short distance, we can use bicycles or take a walk instead of cars. on the one hand, people can also use public transfortation when they go to their company.
to sum up, it is clear that continually using artificial objects can make our earth warmer, nevertheless, the issue can be resolved by using the proper amount of home appliances or reduce the amount of uses of vehicles.",6.5
the flow chart illustrates the consequence of deforestation. summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.you should write at least 150 words.,"the supplied illustration outlines the problems of cutting forests. as we can see, there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue, caused by deforestation.
according to the first branch from the left, forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and ""baked"". it occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil, as the first block of the chart says. because soil becomes ""baked"", rain water starts to run off which causes flooding.
if we look at the remaining branches, we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion - less biodiversity. but there are three different reasons for it. the first one is soil erosion. when we cut the trees, we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes.
the second reason - increased risk of burning. it is followed by the destruction of waste wood. then we have some micro-organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation. and it's all resulted in less biodiversity.
the last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air, so less moisture enters the air. this triggers less precipitation, and so, increased droughts. plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity.
to conclude everything, the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation.",7.5
present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:under british and australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. this protects the person who is being accused of the crime.some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case.do you agree or disagree?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"in the uk and australia, a jury is not provided with the defendant's previous criminal history. some law representatives claim that this should be reverted, and the jury must be provided with this information beforehand. i fully agree with this statement since the jury will have a better understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final decision will be easier to understand for the audience.
having the jury the right access to the defendant's past criminal background, would provide the jury with enough information about the defendant's behaviour. this is because there are certain previous criminal behavioural patterns which allow a better profesional decision-making from the part of the jury. for example, a recent study of the law's practice of melboune, has shown that around 77% of people who commit a crime, were involved in at least one criminal event in the past with similar characteristics to the current crime.
on the other hand, if the jury has access to the defendant's past criminal history, it would be easier for the audience to understand the nature of the jury's final decision. this is because there have been cases in which the jury's final decision was not completely accepted by the audience or misunderstood. therefore, providing the jury with enough criminal backgroud records of the defendant will make it clear to understand in beased of what or why the jury's final decision was made.
in conclusion, in the uk and australia, a jury does not have access to a defendant's previous criminal records, and some law representatives claim that this should be reverted. i fully agree with this statement since being provided with this documents will allow the jury a more understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final jury's decision will be easier to understand for the audience.",6.5

to begin with, working is considered one of the crucial factors to fulfill people's life. specifically, most people would be satisfied when they are helpful to others through their work. besides, these experiences would easily contribute them to further hard work. above all, human beings originally like being appreciated by someone. to be more specific, i like my job because i can feel self-confident through my work. it is manifest that money is not only the vital motivation for working in this regard.
some augments can be made that social status gained through the success of their business must be crucial enough to direct people to work. the main reason for this is that experiences of success would bring excitement and happiness to them. they also could feel superior to others. close examination would reveal that people with high social status could have tons of options compared with common people. that is to say, it is completely evident that higher social status can become an important factor as money.
having considered all the augments above, i would conclude that only money has the most influence on motivation for business. there must be other vital factors present such as social statius and rewarding/",6.0
people living in large cities have to face many problems in everyday life. what are those problems?should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"living in both big cities and regional towns have their own advantages and disadvantages. although, regional towns are small and provide a simple lifestyle, i still think that large cities offer a better lifestyle and much better facilities.
it is true that regional towns have a simpler lifestyle and are not completely industrialized, which leads to a better environment and healthier people. some people say that large cities have a few problems like traffic and high population. i, however, believe that the advantages of living in a big city, completely outweigh the disadvantages.
firstly, due the modernisation and globalisation of industries, various multinational companies look for employees and are usually situated in urban areas. people move from rural areas to urban towns to look for employment with higher salaries as well as international exposure. secondly, cities have a vast network of transportation available which is more frequent and comfortable for the commuters. many people from small towns transit through big cities for inter-state or international travels. lastly, large towns provide better accommodation for people with better living facilities. they have huge buildings with many apartments which are very well structured. these buildings also have facilites like gym, pools, grocery shops e.t.c. so that residents don't have to travel far. which is why, when people move from small towns, it is easier for them to rent a room according to their budget and requirements.
in conclusion, while i strongly believe that one should visit regional towns from time to time to freshen up their mind and body, i completely disagree with the fact that people should be encouraged by the government to permanently move to these areas .",6.5
should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?,"some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. discuss both views and give your opinion.throwing parties can be expensive. while some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.people choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. for starters, they can make better teams. project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. from our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. in addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.the popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. they are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. this is a clinic symptom which psychologists call “social anxiety disorder”. there are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. for instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.in my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.this is a very good essay. other than minor inaccuracies there are no problems (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). seems to be worth ielts band 8.",8.0

then, under the covered area, some air is pumped through an air pump facing the door. this step is followed by a watering action that reaches 8 metres in height. finally, the area is left setting for about 20-24 hours until the storage area is created.",8.0
"write about the following topic.although there are a lot of translation software available, learning a language could still be advantageous. to what extent do you agree or disagree?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","translation softwares are a convenience that we see popping up more and more around us these days. i have seen these being used in daily life around me even very recently. for example, i was recently at the airport to travel from the east coast to the west coast of the us. while there, a passenger in line before me at the luggage drop off had his phone out and was talking to the attendants using his phone. on paying closer attention i realized, he was using a translation software to understand what they said and to respond back to them. it took some effort on both sides, but in the end, it worked!
this is a real-life example of translation software making peoples' lives easier on a regular basis. witnessing this got me thinking - what would have happened in the absence of this service being available literally on the tips of our fingers. in the absence of this easy access to technology as we have today however, it has come down to one thing - the human capacity to learn and communicate in more than one language.
coming from a multicultural background where none of my neighbors spoke the same language as me, it was inevitable that i would be exposed to multiple languages since childhood. this is a reality for most metropolitan cities around the world. when i was three years old and could communicate to some degree in my mother tongue or native language, my father ensured i also learned another one of our national languages that was prevalent in the region. by the time i was six-seven years old, i could conveniently speak in two languages. meanwhile, in school, i was being exposed to the english alphabet in addition to the two other languages which made it easy to learn and understand english too. i can categorically say that knowing all three languages made my life infinitely easier for me since we moved around a lot due to my father's work arrangements.
later on, during my college days, i met my best friend of eighteen years and was exposed to her native language or mother tongue and since then have picked up a passing knowledge of the language as well. the movies and plays around us while young used multiple languages too and as a result i have a passing knowledge of six languages today. this knowledge not only makes communicating a breeze for me in most areas in my country, it keeps my brain active.
in conclusion, i believe while translation softwares definitely make life easier for us on different occasions, being bilingual, trilingual, or a polyglot serves to make life interesting and easy at the same time. truly understanding and speaking a language brings to light so many nuanced facets of an entire culture surrounding the language which cannot be translated through a translation software. it has been proven that learning multiple languages helps keep the human brain adaptable and flexible - all marks of a young and active mind. from my personal experiences, i believe that the translation softwares serve as a quick solution to the language barrier for people in general, learning a language brings in a level of richness to ones experience of life as a whole. translations softwares should therefore not be considered as a replacement for learning a language but as an aide to learning a new skill.",7.5

it is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"throughout history, adult people have been those who worked on farms and they also were responsible for breeding animals. recently, it has been suggested that kids in elementary schools should also take part in such occupations. in this essay, i will count possible advantages as well as some disadvantages of such a change in life, in order to conclude whether or not it is a cost effective notion.
it is commonly believed that the enviroment has been endangered by imminent risks. some people speculate that humans have been less connected to nature and therefore are not aware of the detrimental effects of their activities on the environment. thus, teaching children how to raise up vegetables and how to get along with pets can probably strengthen bonds between children and nature in early phases of life. furthermore, if children grew plants in early stage of life, they would develop unique creative skills alongside enhancing their productivity. moreover, some experts claim that treating animals may benefit children as it would improve their social and communicational skills.
on the other hand, there is another aspect which merits futher consideration. some plants are known to be poisonous and unsafe to young people. in addition, growing plants and spending time on farms might make children prone to a few insects and reptiles which can be really dangerous. finally, animals could be harmful if they are treated inappropriately.
to recapitulate, as we try to wiegh up the pros and cons of such an enterprise, i still reckon that the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages. however, in order guarantee the possible advantages i have mentioned upun above, certain safety measures should be taken to offset the potential risks opposed to children as they are in proximity to plants and animals.",7.5

i think that the first solution has to come from the house, with the parents. it's critical that parents are properly informed about these situation and have the correct preparation to handel it.
continuing with the idea of the first step has to come from house, the school were your child is attending they could give a seminary about bulling and the consequences. and inform parents that the school will have zero tolerance in this cases.
also i think that you have to make aware your child about these situation and talk to them. explain why its not good to bullying someone because there race, color or the way they think. tell them that a show of maturity is to learn to respect the different thinking of people.
like ones president benito juárez said ""the respect to the right of others is the peace"".
when i was at elementary these term wasn't around but it doesn't mean that bulling doesn't exist. in may days it was common that someone was bulling another student but the times it happened these students, stand for them selves so that's were it was over.
so also teach your child to learn to defend themselves and to no tolerate these type of behavior. tache them that they will always can come to talk to you and help them solve these types of situations and also if they are wittnes of these type of behavior, to don't be indifferent and take a posture of defend the other child.

competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. how does competitiveness affect individuals? is it a positive or negative trend?,"in recent years there has been a great deal of discussion about competition. a number of people are of the opinion that competitiveness ought to be in a modern society. personally, i assume that it is a great opportunity for people to develop their skills, relationships, imrove the level of knowledge and become a leader in different spheres. in this essay, i shall examine the way it has an influence on people and inderstand whether it is a beneficial quality.
analyzing the impact of competitiveness, i agree that it helps people with trying to give all the best and not let another person to win. moreover, if there were no competitiveness at my school, i would not try to do various projects or developing my skills to be an excellent student. this quality helps me always raise the bar even more. also, i know that many famous brends such as louis vuitton and gucci compete with each other all the time to take a leadership position in a fashion world.
as for being positive or negative, i am of the opinion that competitiveness is a positive trend due to numerous reasons. first of all, analyzing sports competition, i understand that it is a social process, depending on the biological and social changes that all people are going through. secondly, in an age of social media and growing individualism, time spent interacting and communicating with others is reducing. however, our ability to work with others to achieve a common goal is an essential skill to develop, not only in sport but in life.
in coclusion, a competition can improve people's all-round development while it can give exceeding pressure on them more than they can deal with. however, in my opinion, i tend to believe that the benefits of competition outweigh its disadvantages.",6.0
"in some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. why? should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?","classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. however, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. i believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and i will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.
first of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. that is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. however, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. for instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.
another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. in most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.
to summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. as far as i am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.",7.0

to begin with, technological progress, which is making major strides in our daily lives, is the means by which local mores, custom and traditions could be brought back to life, proving they are compatible. in fact, by tapping technology to make tradition far more attractive, considerably more audience will be engaged into such activities. bologna is a case in point, since, thanks to digital machines and drones which have supported housewives into the making of , the traditional celebration of “making pasta day ” has recently being turned into a successful events, which draws people from country as far afield as china.
another example of possible coexistence is the possibility to heighten awareness of people costumes through the creation of pilot projects which bring both habits and technology to a new whole level. this can be put into practice by setting a direct connection to cultural heritage of a specific area of the world to those who do not have access easily. to this end, many primary schools in new york have developed a project in which, owing to the ultimate high speed connection, pupils who come from abroad can learn ancient craft directly from a master located in their country of origin.
to conclude, i firmly believe that traditional culture and technology development are widely compatible as the technology can positively beef up the presence of cultural traditions nowadays, so as to keep its memory alive. in addition, pioneering projects can be implemented to underpin cultural awareness amongst youngsters.",7.0

to begin with, buying things online can be much easier compared to conventional type of shopping due to the number of reasons. first of all, almost all people in our world have a connection to the internet where you can find whatever you want, starting from analyzing crucial information, ending with buying products online. the first reason is the fact that you can find a great amount of websites prepared for shopping. these websites have clothes, products, technics and other stuff you need. for instance, people can buy fruits and/or vegetables from other countries, so, it means that they can discover culture of people living there.
as for traditional shopping, it is time-consuming because you need to drive or go around the town looking for things you need. in fact, people who choose conventional type of shopping need a great time of preparation to go there because they need to look good, especially if they are the governor ones or even another important people in area they live.
in conclusion, every person has to choose his own preferable type of shopping because evryone has different opinions. also, if there were no online shopping, people would have less things the want to buy.",6.0

it is debated that childhood obesity is mainly the parents responsibility for various reasons. many parents schedueles and lifestyles are not fit for having a child as their routines are not flexible enough to properly take care of him/her. for example, in most western houses, both the mother and the father have jobs to attend everyday, and dont return home to their children till the late afternoon. by that time, the parents will both be too exausted to properly look after their child, which will lead to him/her eating any food no matter its quality and source such as fast foods and sweets, which are calorie dense and low volume. furthermore, studies have shown that around 42 percent of parents in the united states did not care what their child consumed given it was cheap and does not require preparation. as far as i am concerned, this is enough evidence to justify it being mostly the parents fault.
on the other hand, others argue that it is primarely the governments fault. governments have complete control over what advertisements can or cannot be portrayed to the public. knowing that most advertisements we see are related to fast food chains and chocolate bars, we can deduce that it undoubtebly has a major effect on children which will beg their parents. to try some of this food. in addition, it has been scientifically proven that fast foods contain substances which encourage addiction. so when fast foods are easily accesible no matter which city you are in, parents will have a hard time controlling which foods their children eat. i agree that the government has a major influence on children, but their parents have greater controll over them.
in conclusion, while the government is undoubtebly the root of obesity amongst children, it is completely up to the parents to either develop this problem or put limitations to it.",7.5

"in recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. what are the changes occurring? do you think these changes are positive or negative?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","in our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. these changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. in addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. and i believe its an advantageous development.
fathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. as an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.
it appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.
as in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.
in conclusion, the family system nowadays differs vastly from before, owing to the more roles that women are taking, and to the more rights and freedom they gained, and in my perspective it is a positive change.",6.5

there are several reasons why this situation could happen -more specifically- in third world countries. first of all, lack of higher education cirtifactes holder or scientists in the fisrt place could be the reason for the small number of school professors teaching different kind of science subjects. moreover, some people think of science as an additional subject rather than a basic life knowledge and point on these kind of lectures as secondary subjectes.
on the other hand, in result of the science negligence in these countries, we would see a lower awareness among the society which also affects the rate of science discovery and innovations. in another point of view, increasing the importance of science in life and schools could stimulate the creative minds to exceed further in every aspect of life. there are several suggestions in my opinion is important to implement in the educaion and parenting systems to ensure a adequate scientific base for childern and students. to begin with, we could add the basic subects in schools like; physics, chemistry and biology as a start and then increase the complexity of the lessons and science theories each grade. additionally, parents could read simple science books to their children from the very first years of life so they can have a good platform to the scientific ideas of the universe.

there are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. first, studying science can be hard and exhausting. the complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. as for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.
the importance of people having knowledge in science is great. the society relies on science on a daily basis. for instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. in addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.
discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. however, it is vital for the society that students will study science. without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.",7.5
should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?,"while recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. to what extent do you agree or disagree? give your opinion and include relevant examples.recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. but how do we determine if a person is the best fit? advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. in my view, both components are of equal importance.to begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, linkedin profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a cv while a cover letter is optional. without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.on the other hand, occasionally during an interview some hr officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. the more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. kpmg is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. this methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.to summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.this response covers the topic well. the writer’s position is clearly expressed and supported by an example, the use of paragraphing makes this essay organised and easy to follow. linking words are used appropriately. the use of complex sentences and advanced vocabulary is impressive. overall, this essay is likely to score band 8 in ielts.",8.0

initially, people have a long history of how they improved their lifestyles drastically and violently from ancient times around the world. people kept fighting to increase their country's territory and caused innumerable victims. in addition, there were slaves who were occupied by invaders. as a result, they were often forced to move to another continent, such as america for the workforce and looked down on slaves. if people ignore learning this historical background, they will continue fighting and discriminating against them. therefore, learning history will lead to how necessary to treat human rights equally.
secondly, when it comes to the environment, there are several issues. some disasters and global warming are triggered by human's sustainable long historical actions. after the industrial revolution that occurred in the 18th century, we consumed a lot of resources such as oil and coal, and the carbon dioxide emissions caused climate change such as global warming.
in addition, repeated deforestation led to floods and a sharp decline in native species. unless people know the reason why such a revolution happened by history, people will take another action that is harmful to the global environment.
finally, the causes of our modern society's problems as i mentioned above can be recognized by studying history. people need to take responsibility for a peaceful and eco-friendly society by considering a variety of views in history.",6.0

it is clear that india steadily increases the percentage of its population since 1950. specifically, the percentage in each period is 15 percent, around 17 percent, and will be approximately 18 percent, in 1950, 2002, and 2050 respectively. in contrast, china used to be the highest percentage of population in 1950 and 2002. the each percentage indicates more than 23 percent in 1950 and dropped to 20 percent in 2002. furthermore, the prediction about population will plummet to 15 percent.
interestingly, firstly japan was the smallest percentage in 4 countries in 1950 and slightly goes down in 2002. the percentage seems to be about 4 percent in 1950 and its percentage will plummet to approximately 1 percent in 2050. the usa also goes down population 5 percent in 2002, but the percentage will stay the same in 2050.",6.5
some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. there are more beneficial ways to spend this money. to what extend do you agree or disagree?,"space, so unknown for the humankind that it generates so much curiosity among experts and enterprenues. due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.
firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. if with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.
secondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. the ceos of some of the most profitable business in america are investigating this possibility. the leading enterprises in this sector are blue origin from jeff bezos and space x from elon musk. when discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.
in a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue. from my point of view, even though here on earth there are several problems to be solve with money, our future lies on space, so be must spend as much money as possible.",7.0

in australia, we can see that in the year of 1995, the rate of males getting employed was more than that of females getting employed with males standing at 55% employment, and females on the other hand at only about 25-27% employment. in fact, it can be seen that the rate of employment for males in both the years, 1995 and 2005 is more than that of the females!
resonating with the point made above, despite the slight increase in the rate of females getting employed, the males still towered the 2005 comparison in the rate of employment, standing at 69%, leaving the females at an slightly increased 39%.
in switzerland on the other hand, although the rate of employment went to the males in both years of 1995 and 2005, there is only a slight difference between the rates. in the year of 1995, the rate of swiss men getting employed stood at 65% with females only being 8% behind, standing at about 58%. meanwhile, in the year of 2005, the rate of swiss males employed shot up at a whopping 79%, leaving the females only 10% behind, at about 69%.

"some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. discuss both views and give your own opinion.","it is often argued out there about sports, debating about both physcial and mental strengths and which is far more crucial to the success. this essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.
on one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as mma fights, wrestling, football, and so on. all of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. for example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.
on the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. that is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. people need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. for example, some mma athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. it's all about the mindset.
in conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. however, i believe that any athlete must have these two, train them both before getting into any challenge, no matter what type of activity. an athlete must have a strong body and a trained attitude once and for all.",6.5

write about the following topic.some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. to what extent do you agree or disagree?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"some people and governments believe in reducing the carbon dioxide of cars and other vehicles is the most effective way to solve the environment problem. although there are some points also neccesaliry developed except for car and other vehicles, i believe spending the cost of fuel for cars which do not emit detrimental substances play the biggest effect for environmental improvement.
cars, and other vehicles, such as airplanes are ubiquitous around the world. people rely on most transport type must be cars around the world, even in developing countries. in addition, recent cars released in a few decades tend to be durable and the most of energy is petrol which resource is made of fossil fuel. this means that cars emit carbon dioxide across the globe and the highest volume of carbon dioxide is considered by cars. therefore, the majority of fact about global warming is caused by cars and airplanes.
recently, the car industry has become aware of this issue and they are starting manufacturing cars that never emit carbon dioxide. for example, some companies, especially tesla, and porsche had already released cars that consume energy as electricity, instead of petrol. this effort will cause a drastic reduction of transmitting carbon dioxide and some countries are planning to regulate laws all cars have to consume energy only by electricity.
finally, of course, there are other issues that lead to harmful environments around the world, such as deforestation, disposal of rubbish by incineration, and agriculture. for example, growing cows too much will generate methane gas which also relates to global warming. however, there is no doubt the total volume of the environmental problem must be cars; and other vehicles. hence, it is the most effective to shift energy resources from detrimental and limited to sustainable and clean energy in the car industry must be a valuable first step to resolve environmental problems.",5.0

first of all, children and young people need to be protect from these violent informations. one mean to accomplish that, is to explain to them these kind of violent images. because, they are in fairly part of their development and that could be have a huge impact on their mental health. for instance, if your children saw an image of attentat in a high school, as a result, it could be difficult for him to go back at school further. morover, he could likely developed mental health problem, as a phobia or anxiety about high school.
on the other hand, it is important to keep inform them about the real world and they need to be prepare for theses situations. for example, if an attack arrived at their school, your children will be prepared for. conversely, if they did not watched news, and an attack reached the school, they will not be able to protect them and the consequence could be terrible. as far, news allow us to predict the world and be able to protect us and our family.

first of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. it is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. for instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. i am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.
secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. that is why this responsibility goes on their parents. as it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. there is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. for example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. in this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.

the advantages of the spread of english as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"since the middle of the 19th century, english is recognized as the most important language and world common language. there is a variety of advantages because the number of english speakers, including non-native speakers has been increasing across the globe. i strongly agree with this phenomenon.
to go into detail, european countries, such as switzerland, and belgium are configured with some languages in one country, such as german, french, and italian. therefore, english is categorized as a common language in these countries. in addition, the us and european countries have been leading in a variety of fields, such as science, technology, and academic topics. therefore, some countries, including germany, the netherlands, and north european countries followed learning english to keep up with technology. therefore, the number of non-native speakers has widely and drastically increased in europe to communicate smoothly. as a result, since internet technology has widely spread around the world, japanese people can search for any kind of information in english more than five times higher than searching for the same information in japanese. therefore, learning english is inevitable for japanese people, as well as other asian countries or developing countries.
fortunately, thanks to recent technology, it is getting easier to study english. for example, online english lessons, such as cambly allows us to learn english 24/7. in addition, in some social media, the name of an app ""club house"" is a convenient app to have a conversation with the same users worldwide. therefore, we can easily share cultural differences and tips to improve our english skill.
in contrast, some people are concerned about their own native language might be vanished in the future. in iceland, although there is a native language, ""icelandish"" language still remains and is spoken in iceland, but some people are anxious the language's complex grammar and vocabulary are difficult to explain in some detail. according to the researcher, they are astonished young students are all hanging out only in english, instead of icelandish. therefore, the government has been making an effort to maintain the native language by taking advantage of national media such as, podcast, radio, tv broadcast are only spoken in icelandish language.
finally, thanks to english language, more people are willing to communicate with a lot of people who speak english. this phenomenon is not only convenient to understand cultural differences, but also helpful to learn a variety of subject in english for developing countries, like in the philipinnes. tagalogue language is limited to cover some vocabulary to learn academic subjects.

write about the following topic.some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"in regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.
there are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low eq or lacking interaction ability. for instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. by being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.
on the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. they will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.
all in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people.",6.0

the 1998 floor plans show that the permanent exhibition rooms, and the cafe, as well as the temporary exhibition room, ticketing counter, and shop were situated around a central garden. the cafe split the permanent exhibition rooms into two sides of the garden. the 2008 changes in the plans indicate that while the permanent exhibition rooms were moved to be on right side of the garden, a portion of garden was carved out to work as a sitting area for the cafe. a restaurant was also added next to the cafe right past the temporary exhibition room which is now sits on the other left side of the garden. the garden was renovated to include two new water features in the form of fountains. the wc is now located next to the cafe adjoining the permanent exhibition rooms.",6.5

write about the following topic.many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. why? does this development have advantages and disadvantages?give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"it is noticeable that when we write something we try to use more informal language. moreover the written text is more redundant, cohesive, calm and patient. from my point of view, it comes because we erase emotions from written text which we spread sometimes without intention via voice. not only voice influence on it, but during the writing we have a chance to revise and check our text. moreover this fact has advantages and disadvantages.
on the one hand, there is a huge advantage of this cartain. when we communicate through formal language and when we are more relaxed we have a chance to spread our ideas more thoroughly. for instance, i sometimes observe that for me it is easier to convince someone to help me if i write to him or her.
on the other hand, there is a disadvantage, that when we switch on to the speech from writing other people will be surprised or astonished with the differences. for example, during my work, i communicate via messages more than via calling. sometimes there are cases when after this switching people notice that i was rude and insult them.
finally, written language is more relaxed and less formal. this fact has a lot of cons and pros. i think that cons dominate under pros. what is more, it is a nice way to mix this kind of communication for best results. neither written way nor speaking will increase your chance to be recognizable in the right way if your basic idea is not relevant to consumers of your main idea.",5.0
"write about the following topic.people in all modern societies use drugs, but today's youth are experimenting with both legal and illegal drugs, and at an increasingly early age. some sociologists claim that parents and other members of society often set a bad example.discuss the causes and some effects of widespread drug use by young people in modern day society. make any recommendations you feel are necessary to help fight youth drug abuse.give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","there is an increasing number of improper drug users in the modern society, especially the adolescents and teenagers experimenting with various drugs, regardless of the legality of such drugs. this phenomenon spurs the discussion about the underlying reasons, such as the detrimental influence of parents and other people acting improperly. this essay will explore the causes and impacts of extensive drug use among young people, and introduce plausible suggestions to address this issue.
the dominant cause of this problem is the publicity of pharmaceutical companies that exaggerating the efficacy of their products while playing down or concealing the side effects of such drugs, notably, the drugs that can alleviate the tiredness and improve the mood while risking addiction or even the loss of rationality. these drugs help teenagers a lot in terms of avoiding the sleepiness, especially in classes and lectures where they have to focus on the knowledge points expressed by teachers and lecturers. however, given the lack of information about the adverse effects involved, teenagers may gradually get addicted to such drugs. the other contributing factor is the absence of attention paid by parents who more often than not, have to deal with the tremendous workload so that they have little time spent with their children. the improper drug use exerts far-reaching impacts on teenagers and adolescents. the most notable effect in this regard is the deterioration of health conditions, both physically and mentally, as exemplified by the higher frequency of asthma and the worsening ability of socialising.
to tackle this problem, it is necessary for pharmacential corporations to clarify the pros and cons of their products, and for parents to spend more time with their children to identify potential hazards. i expect in the future, more suggestions could arise to solve the problem of drug abuse among young people.",8.0
